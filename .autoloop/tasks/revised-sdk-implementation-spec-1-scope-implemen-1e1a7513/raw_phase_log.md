I’m treating the pasted spec as the implementation contract and checking the current SDK, engine prompt resolution, and existing plan artifacts before I write the phase plan.

I’ve confirmed there are no later clarifications in the raw log, so the spec in the request snapshot remains the contract. Next I’m mapping the current SDK and engine surfaces against the requested behavior to keep the plan grounded in actual code structure.

The current SDK already has a synthetic single-step workflow path and basic MVP guards, but it still returns raw `ArtifactHandle`s and only imports `BranchGroupStep`, `ChildWorkflowStep`, and `Step`. I’m drilling into the single-step routing and result-building pieces now because those are the highest regression surfaces in this spec.

I’ve confirmed the routing gap: synthetic workflows currently derive transitions from `route_metadata` and otherwise force `"done" -> FINISH`, so explicit `SELF` or produce/verify defaults are not preserved today. I’m checking the current test layout and runtime metadata helpers now so the plan can be phased around the real extension points instead of duplicating resolution logic.

The main regression harness already lives in `tests/unit/test_sdk_facade.py`, so the cleanest plan is to extend that file plus a few contract-style prompt tests rather than invent a new test surface. I’m reading the current SDK tests and runtime context helpers to pin down exactly where retention metadata can be derived without drifting from existing runtime structures.

The runtime already exposes nearly all of the context fields the spec wants for write resolution, including `request_file`, `task_request_file`, package/run/workflow folders, and the session store snapshot. I’m checking persisted run metadata next so the cleanup plan can stay conservative about failed or awaiting-input runs instead of guessing from directory names.

I have enough repository context to write an implementation-ready plan. One last pass is on the runner’s result serialization helpers so I can call out the exact reuse points for declared-write resolution and avoid inventing parallel metadata assembly in the plan.

I’m writing the plan artifacts now. The plan is structured around the actual change seams in `autoloop/sdk.py`, `autoloop/__init__.py`, `autoloop/core/engine.py`, and `tests/unit/test_sdk_facade.py`, with the behavioral breaks called out explicitly so the implementer doesn’t drift.

The planner artifacts are updated. I’m doing a quick verification pass on the written files to make sure the phase graph, compatibility notes, and decisions block stayed consistent with the spec and runtime-owned YAML metadata constraints.

Updated the planning artifacts for this run:

The plan is split into four ordered phases: SDK surface/result-model changes, retention and safe cleanup, routing/helper entrypoints plus prompt rendering, and focused regression tests. The main non-obvious callouts are the intentional public SDK result change from `ArtifactHandle` to `ResultArtifact`, and the requirement that cleanup/deletion stay sentinel-gated and conservative.
