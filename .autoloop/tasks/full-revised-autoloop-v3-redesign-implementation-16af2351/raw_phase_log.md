I’m grounding the plan in the authoritative request, existing plan artifacts, and the current workflow/runtime structure before I rewrite anything. Next I’m checking the run files and the code paths that define workflows, routes, artifacts, sessions, and compilation so the phase breakdown matches the real refactor surface.

The run log has no later clarification entries, so the initial spec is still the contract. I’ve confirmed the current planning artifacts are effectively empty, and now I’m mapping the actual framework modules so the milestones line up with the existing compiler/runtime seams instead of inventing a parallel architecture.

The public compatibility layer is thin, but the contract surface underneath is broad: tests and runtime still depend heavily on `SUCCESS`, global `transitions`, `produces`, `RouteInfo`, and old step types. I’m drilling into the underlying `autoloop_v3.core` compiler/runtime modules next so the plan explicitly separates compatibility lowering from deeper engine work.

I’ve confirmed the package layout: `autoloop/` is a public facade over a repo-root `core/` runtime, with a large compatibility test suite around it. The plan needs to treat this as a staged lowering refactor, not a clean-slate package redesign, so I’m reading the compiler, route, step, and validation code paths directly before I write the milestones.

The core currently validates workflows at class creation and compiles immutable steps/routes, but ordering still depends on module-level counters in `core/steps.py`, and the engine still treats `SUCCESS` as the terminal identity. I’m checking the specific discovery, transition normalization, prompt-reference, and graph-export code paths now so the plan can name the exact regression surfaces and acceptance tests.

The main seams are clear now. Simple authoring is already lowered through `core.validation`, but only partially: step-local `routes` exist for the facade, prompt-read inference is limited, entry inference is heuristic, reserved control routes are always injected, route metadata still splits across `Route` and `RouteInfo`, and engine/static graph/output contracts still speak in old `SUCCESS`/`produces` terms. I’m checking the doc/test expectations and the current feedback artifact now, then I’ll write the concrete phased plan and risk register.

Plan direction is settled. I’m writing a five-phase refactor plan that follows the spec’s own migration order, but tied to the actual modules and regression surfaces here: `autoloop/simple.py`, `core/validation.py`, `core/compiler.py`, `core/engine.py`, `runtime/static_graph.py`, CLI inspection output, docs, and the compatibility-heavy test suites.

I have enough context to write the artifacts. I’m updating the plan, machine-readable phases, feedback note, and durable decisions together so later implement/test turns have one consistent contract and don’t drift back toward the legacy surface.

The artifacts are written. I’m validating `phase_plan.yaml` with `yaml.safe_load` now and doing a quick coherence pass on the plan/decisions content before I close the turn.

The first validation command failed because this environment has `python3`, not `python`. I’m re-running the required `yaml.safe_load` check with `python3` and then I’ll close the plan turn.

Updated the planning artifacts at [plan.md](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/plan/plan.md), [phase_plan.yaml](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/plan/phase_plan.yaml), [feedback.md](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/plan/feedback.md), and [decisions.txt](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/decisions.txt). The plan now follows a lowering-first implementation strategy across five ordered phases: canonical surface/topology, `do_review_step`, hook/state/session/topology metadata, feedforward `llm`/`classify`, then workflow migration and cleanup.

The written plan is tied to the actual repository seams in `autoloop/simple.py`, `core/validation.py`, `core/compiler.py`, `core/engine.py`, `runtime/static_graph.py`, docs, and the compatibility-heavy test suites. It also makes the main intentional break explicit: hook-based route redirection should be retired in the hook/state phase rather than preserved implicitly.

Verification: `phase_plan.yaml` was parsed successfully with `python3` using `yaml.safe_load` (`parsed_ok 5`).

I’m auditing the generated plan against the full redesign spec, not just checking formatting. First I’m re-reading the written artifacts, the criteria, and the authoritative request/decisions to identify any missing intent coverage, unsafe regressions, or phase-contract gaps before I mark criteria or append findings.

I’ve identified three blocking gaps: two are intent-coverage holes in core public API/compiler behavior, and one is a sequencing conflict between the written plan and the shared decisions on when docs/examples must leave the legacy surface. I’m appending them to verifier feedback now; the criteria remain unchecked because the plan is not yet safe to mark complete.

Scope considered

- The authoritative request snapshot, raw log, shared decisions, and the generated planning artifacts under `.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/plan`.

What I analyzed

- Intent coverage against the redesign spec, especially public API targets, compiler responsibilities, prompt/reference behavior, compatibility rules, intentional behavior breaks, and migration sequencing.
- `phase_plan.yaml` structure and dependency ordering.
- Consistency between `plan.md`, `phase_plan.yaml`, and `decisions.txt`.

What I reviewed

- `plan.md` for milestone coverage, risk controls, migration notes, and rollback planning.
- `phase_plan.yaml` for parseability, phase coherence, acceptance criteria, and deferments.
- `feedback.md` continuity and `criteria.md` gating state.
- `decisions.txt` for sequencing constraints that later turns must not contradict.

Key findings / decisions

- `phase_plan.yaml` is valid YAML and structurally coherent enough to parse, but the plan is not complete.
- `PLAN-001` blocking: the plan does not explicitly schedule the requested `python_step` public API shape, return contract, and `system_step` compatibility migration.
- `PLAN-002` blocking: the plan does not explicitly schedule the redesigned prompt model and placeholder/reference compiler behavior, despite that being a core part of the requested authoring surface and compile-time invariants.
- `PLAN-003` blocking: the plan conflicts with `decisions.txt` on sequencing for docs/examples, deferring them to cleanup even though the shared decision says the canonical surface must be reflected immediately.
- `criteria.md` remains unchecked because intent fidelity, behavioral safety, completeness, technical debt control, and compatibility planning are not yet satisfied with those gaps.

Open issues / next step

- The planner needs to revise `plan.md` and `phase_plan.yaml` to add explicit `python_step` scope, explicit prompt/reference compiler scope, and consistent early docs/examples migration sequencing.
- After that revision, re-run verification against the same criteria and shared decisions.

I’m revising the plan against the verifier’s blocking findings, not broadening scope. First I’m checking the current feedback and decision blocks so I can patch the existing plan/phase contract precisely around the missing `python_step`, prompt/reference compiler scope, and the docs/examples sequencing conflict.

I’ve got the fix shape. I’m tightening phase 1 around the missing public API/compiler work and splitting docs migration into “canonical public guidance immediately” versus “mechanical bundled workflow cleanup later,” so the plan matches both the spec and the decisions ledger.

The YAML patch missed because the file is currently unquoted and normalized differently than the earlier authored form. I’m re-reading the exact file content and then I’ll patch the narrative and YAML separately with smaller, exact-context edits.

I have the exact replacements now. I’m rewriting `plan.md` and the `phases:` payload in `phase_plan.yaml` in one pass so the narrative plan, machine-readable phases, feedback history, and decision block all say the same thing.

The revisions are in place. I’m validating the YAML with `python3` now and doing one quick consistency pass across `plan.md`, `phase_plan.yaml`, and the new decision block before I hand this back to the verifier.

Revised [plan.md](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/plan/plan.md) and [phase_plan.yaml](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/plan/phase_plan.yaml) to address all three blocking verifier findings. The plan now explicitly puts `python_step` and `system_step` aliasing in phase 1, spells out the requested Python-step return contract, adds prompt declaration/reference compiler work in phase 1 plus the state/item/meta/runtime prompt namespaces in phase 3, and moves the canonical public docs/examples/templates switch into phase 1 while narrowing phase 5 to bundled-workflow migration and cleanup.

I also appended the change note in [feedback.md](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/plan/feedback.md) and added durable sequencing/interface decisions under the current header in [decisions.txt](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/decisions.txt). Verification: `phase_plan.yaml` parses successfully with `python3` via `yaml.safe_load` (`parsed_ok 5`).

I’m re-running the verifier pass on the revised plan against the same spec and the shared decisions. The main focus is whether the prior blockers are actually closed in the narrative plan and phase contract, and whether anything new regressed when those fixes landed.

The revised plan closes the prior blockers on the merits: the missing public API/compiler scopes are now explicit, the sequencing conflict with `decisions.txt` is resolved, the phase boundaries are coherent, and the YAML is valid. I’m marking the criteria complete and appending a final verifier note so the feedback log records that the earlier blockers were addressed.

I’ve updated the gate file and feedback log. I’m doing one last quick read of the criteria and feedback so the final verifier close-out matches the artifact state exactly.

Scope considered

- The authoritative request snapshot, the raw log, the shared decisions ledger, and the current planning artifacts under `.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/plan`.

What I analyzed

- The revised phase coverage for `python_step`, prompt declaration/reference compilation, session semantics, and docs/examples sequencing.
- Compatibility, migration, rollback, and regression-test planning across the five phases.
- `phase_plan.yaml` structure, dependency ordering, and required-list validity.

What I reviewed

- `plan.md` for narrative completeness and alignment with the redesign spec.
- `phase_plan.yaml` for parseability, coherent ordered phases, and explicit acceptance criteria.
- `feedback.md` for continuity and closure of prior blocking findings.
- `criteria.md` for final gate consistency.
- `decisions.txt` for sequencing and non-obvious constraints that the revised plan needed to honor.

Key findings / decisions

- `phase_plan.yaml` parses successfully and required lists are populated.
- The prior blocking findings are addressed: the plan now explicitly covers the `python_step` public API and return contract, the prompt model/reference compiler work, and the immediate switch of canonical public docs/examples/templates in phase 1.
- The revised phase split is coherent: phase 1 owns canonical surface, prompt basics, and public guidance; phase 3 owns the state/item/meta/runtime prompt namespaces and session/state-backed context surfaces.
- Criteria are now fully satisfied and were updated to checked state.
- I appended a non-blocking verifier note to `feedback.md` recording that the earlier blockers were resolved.

Open issues / next step

- No blocking verification issues remain in the planning artifacts.
- The plan pair can advance out of verifier review with the current artifacts as the implementation contract.

I’m treating this as a phase-1 implementation pass on the public authoring surface and compiler lowering. First I’m reading the phase artifacts and the existing workflow/compiler code to identify the smallest safe set of changes that satisfy the acceptance criteria.

The phase notes are still empty, so I’m relying on the plan and the code itself. Next I’m tracing the current public API, workflow declaration layer, and compiler path to see where canonical aliases and topology lowering already exist versus where they need to be added.

I’ve confirmed the repo already has a “simple surface” and route lowering path, which is the right place to land phase 1. Now I’m reading the declaration, validation, prompt, and static graph implementations together so the changes stay compatible with the current runtime contracts.

The compiler already infers some prompt reads and already lowers step-local routes, but it’s still using legacy names, always injects control routes, and doesn’t validate the new placeholder contract. I’m narrowing the work now to the public surface, lowering path, prompt-reference validation, and additive topology artifacts.

I have the main shape now. The lowest-risk implementation is to extend the existing `autoloop.simple -> validation -> compiler -> static_graph/tracing` path rather than inventing a second compiler surface. I’m checking tracing and run-artifact write paths next so topology outputs land additively without breaking existing consumers.

I’ve reached the implementation boundary. The main edits will be: public aliases/constants and prompt helpers in `autoloop`/`core`, deterministic entry and route-target resolution in `core.validation`, Python-step return and `writes` lowering in `autoloop.simple`, and additive topology files in `runtime.static_graph`/`runtime.tracing`, followed by focused tests and doc updates.

I’m starting the code edits at the public surface and route primitives first, because the compiler and docs changes depend on those names existing. After that I’ll wire the lowering and topology artifacts through validation and runtime tracing.

The first patch partially missed `core/__init__.py` because the export block doesn’t match my assumption. I’m reopening the exact file contents and patching the public primitives/export files with precise context.

The public primitive names are in place. I’m patching `autoloop.simple` now so the canonical authoring API is actually usable: `writes`, `python_step`, `do_review_step`, `FINISH`, `SELF`, and the decorator-style Python-step form.

I found a compatibility hazard: making `Route.complete()` canonicalize directly to `FINISH` would fan out into a large number of strict-core tests and compiled-route expectations. I’m keeping legacy `Route.complete()/SUCCESS` behavior intact and restricting `FINISH` to the new simple-surface defaults and explicit `FINISH` targets, which preserves the migration path without broad regressions.

I’m threading the new names into the compiled metadata now. That lets topology files expose canonical `writes`/`FINISH` surfaces without changing the existing engine behavior or legacy static graph payloads.

The topology writer needs the compiled workflow, not the already-rendered legacy graph payload. I’m correcting that wiring now so tracing can emit both legacy and canonical files cleanly.

I spotted one more topology issue before running tests: step-level route payloads were only reading explicit per-step routes, which would have dropped inherited global control routes from `topology.json`. I’m fixing that before validation.

I’ve got the phase scope and the current delta. Next I’m fixing the topology artifact gap, then I’ll run targeted compile/tests against the canonical-surface changes before updating the phase notes and decisions ledger.

The topology payload path already has the global-route fallback wired in. I’m moving straight to validation now so the remaining work is whatever the test surface exposes, not guesswork.

The environment doesn’t expose `python` or `pytest` on PATH. I’m checking the project’s actual interpreter/test entrypoint instead of assuming the shell aliases exist.

There’s a `python3`, but no installed `pytest`. I’m looking for the project’s local virtualenv or alternate runner so I can still validate the phase without hand-waving.

The package CLI surface is green, which reduces the risk that the scaffold migration broke existing expectations. I’m waiting on the canonical-surface suite to finish and will patch only if it exposes an actual contract miss.

The prompt-validation miss is concrete: simple inline string prompts weren’t being treated as prompt text during compile-time placeholder analysis. I’m patching that and then adding the missing working-tree note the doc contract expects.

I’m editing two places now: compile-time prompt text resolution for simple inline prompts, and the missing `cleanup.md` note that the documentation contract treats as part of the active authoring surface.

The canonical-surface suite is now green. I’m doing the phase bookkeeping next: concise implementation notes and any non-obvious decisions that future turns would otherwise miss.

I’m recording the phase intent and the compatibility boundaries now. The main thing worth preserving for later turns is that the canonical surface is exposed in compile artifacts and docs, while runtime success semantics still accept the legacy `SUCCESS` path to avoid a premature engine break.

**Scope considered**
- Phase `canonical-surface-and-topology-lowering` only.
- I kept the work inside the canonical public surface, topology lowering, prompt-reference validation, additive topology artifacts, and public docs/templates.
- I ignored unrelated dirty/deleted files already present elsewhere in the worktree.

**What I analyzed**
- The simple-surface lowering path in `autoloop/simple.py` and `core/validation.py`.
- Compiler/runtime compatibility points in `core/compiler.py`, `core/engine.py`, `runtime/tracing.py`, and `runtime/static_graph.py`.
- Public guidance surfaces in `docs/authoring.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `runtime/cli.py`, and the repo-root working-tree note contract.
- The targeted regression tests covering simple-surface behavior, runtime topology artifacts, docs, and CLI scaffolding.

**What I changed**
- Landed the canonical phase-1 surface: `FINISH`, `SELF`, `python_step`, `do_review_step`, `Prompt.ref`, and `writes`, while preserving `SUCCESS`, `system_step`, `review_step`, `out`, and `outputs` compatibility.
- Lowered step-local routes through the existing FSM path with deterministic class-namespace ordering, first-declared default entry, explicit entry support, string/direct/`SELF` target resolution, and `done -> next/FINISH` defaults.
- Added prompt placeholder validation and inferred reads for compile-time-available prompt text, including `{self.artifact}`, `{step.artifact}`, `{step.value}`, and `{params.field}`.
- Added additive canonical topology artifacts via `runtime/static_graph.py` and runtime tracing, without removing the legacy static graph output.
- Updated public docs and scaffolds to point new authoring toward the canonical surface.
- Added `cleanup.md` because the docs/test contract treats it as an active public guidance file.
- Updated tests to cover the new surface and fixed the one new test that needed to call `compile_workflow(...)` explicitly for compile-time placeholder failure.

**Key findings / decisions**
- Runtime success handling still needs compatibility, so execution accepts both `SUCCESS` and `FINISH`; only topology/docs were canonicalized to `FINISH` in this phase.
- The simple authoring surface does not validate on class definition alone; compile-time prompt failures occur when the workflow is compiled, which is the correct enforcement boundary here.
- The topology artifact path now stays additive, which avoids breaking existing static-graph consumers during migration.
- I recorded the non-obvious compatibility decisions in the phase `implementation_notes.md` and the current-turn block in `decisions.txt`.

**Open issues / next step**
- No blocking issues remain for this phase.
- Out-of-scope items are still deferred: `review_writes`, phase-specific do/review provider contracts, `StateVar`/`Param`, hook-context semantics, and feedforward `llm()` / `classify()`.
- Validation completed: syntax compile passed, `49` targeted canonical-surface tests passed, and `20` package CLI tests passed.

I’m auditing the phase-1 implementation against the acceptance criteria and adjacent compatibility surfaces. First I’m reading the phase artifacts, then I’ll spot-check the touched lowering/runtime paths for gaps the targeted tests may have missed.

I’ve found at least one concrete phase-gap candidate in the docs surface: `docs/authoring.md` still contains public examples using `transitions = {… SUCCESS}` and `Route.to(SUCCESS, …)`, which contradicts the phase requirement to move public examples/templates to the canonical `FINISH`/step-local-routes surface. I’m checking whether there’s also a code-path issue beyond documentation drift.

I found a second concrete issue beyond docs drift: compile-time prompt-reference analysis does not respect `Prompt.ref(...)` registry semantics. In `core/validation.py`, `_simple_prompt_text(...)` resolves any `Prompt.path` against workflow-relative files, so a registry prompt can silently borrow a same-named filesystem prompt during compile-time validation and inferred-read extraction.

Scope considered
- Phase `canonical-surface-and-topology-lowering` only.
- I reviewed the phase artifacts plus the touched authoring, validation, runtime-topology, and docs surfaces needed to judge AC-1 through AC-5.
- I did not expand into unrelated dirty files outside this phase scope.

What I analyzed
- Phase artifacts: `criteria.md`, `feedback.md`, `implementation_notes.md`, and the shared `decisions.txt`.
- Request-relevant code paths in `autoloop/simple.py`, `core/validation.py`, `core/compiler.py`, `runtime/static_graph.py`, `runtime/tracing.py`, and `runtime/runner.py`.
- Public guidance surfaces in `docs/authoring.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `cleanup.md`, and the CLI scaffold path.
- The targeted tests the implementer ran, with focus on gaps not covered by those checks.

What I reviewed
- `FINISH` / `SUCCESS` compatibility handling and canonical topology emission.
- `python_step` lowering and system-step return normalization coverage.
- Step-local route lowering, declaration-order entry/default-next behavior, and named target resolution.
- Compile-time prompt placeholder analysis, especially `Prompt.inline/file/ref`.
- Whether public docs/examples/templates actually moved to the canonical phase-1 surface.

Key findings / decisions
- I recorded two blocking findings in `feedback.md`.
- `IMP-001` blocks on compile/runtime drift for `Prompt.ref(...)`: compile-time prompt analysis currently treats registry prompt paths like filesystem prompt paths when a same-named local file exists.
- `IMP-002` blocks on intent fidelity for AC-5: `docs/authoring.md` still teaches legacy public examples built around `PairStep`, global `transitions`, and `SUCCESS` instead of the canonical `step` / `do_review_step` / `writes` / step-local `routes` / `FINISH` surface.
- Because of those findings, I left the phase criteria unchecked.

Open issues / next step
- Fix `core/validation.py:_simple_prompt_text` so `Prompt.ref(...)` preserves registry semantics during compile-time placeholder analysis, then add a collision regression test.
- Rewrite the remaining legacy public examples in `docs/authoring.md` onto the canonical phase-1 surface and demote legacy transition examples to compatibility-only notes.
- Re-run the targeted phase tests after those fixes and then re-evaluate the criteria.

I’m addressing the two reviewer findings only: `Prompt.ref(...)` compile-time semantics in validation, and the remaining legacy public examples in `docs/authoring.md`. After that I’ll rerun the targeted phase tests and update the phase notes.

I’ve confirmed both findings in-place. I’m patching the validation branch so `Prompt.ref(...)` no longer searches workflow-relative files, then I’m rewriting the remaining legacy examples in `docs/authoring.md` onto the canonical phase-1 simple surface and adding a regression test for the prompt-name collision case.

I’m at the edit stage. The code change is small and centralized in `core/validation.py`; the larger diff is the doc cleanup, where I’m converting the remaining public examples from legacy `PairStep`/`transitions`/`SUCCESS` patterns into the canonical simple-surface equivalents instead of leaving mixed guidance.

The code and doc fixes are in. I’m running the same targeted phase checks plus the simple-surface suite again to make sure the registry-prompt change didn’t create a validation regression elsewhere.

The reviewer-specific fixes are green. I’m just updating the phase ledger now so the next turn doesn’t lose the semantic boundary we restored for `Prompt.ref(...)`.

Scope considered
- Phase `canonical-surface-and-topology-lowering` only.
- I addressed the two reviewer findings in the active phase feedback: `IMP-001` and `IMP-002`.
- I did not pull unrelated dirty files into scope.

What I analyzed
- `core/validation.py` compile-time prompt text resolution for `Prompt.ref(...)` versus `Prompt.file(...)`.
- The remaining legacy public examples in [docs/authoring.md](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/docs/authoring.md).
- The existing simple-surface tests around prompt metadata and compile-time placeholder validation.

What I changed
- In [core/validation.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/core/validation.py), `_simple_prompt_text(...)` now preserves registry semantics by not searching workflow-relative files for `Prompt.ref(...)`.
- In [tests/unit/test_simple_surface.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/tests/unit/test_simple_surface.py), I added a regression test covering a registry prompt name that collides with a local file.
- In [docs/authoring.md](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/docs/authoring.md), I rewrote the remaining public examples away from `PairStep`, global `transitions`, and `SUCCESS` toward `step(...)` / `do_review_step(...)`, `writes`, step-local `routes`, `FINISH`, and `SELF`.
- I updated the phase [implementation_notes.md](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/implement/phases/canonical-surface-and-topology-lowering/implementation_notes.md) and appended the non-obvious `Prompt.ref(...)` semantics note under the current turn header in [decisions.txt](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/decisions.txt).

Key findings / decisions
- `Prompt.ref(...)` compile-time analysis now matches runtime intent: registry prompts no longer inherit same-named local prompt files during placeholder validation or inferred-read extraction.
- The public authoring doc no longer uses legacy transition/SUCCESS examples as primary guidance for the phase-1 surface.
- Validation passed after the fixes: `python3 -m py_compile core/validation.py` and `70` targeted tests passed across simple-surface, runtime-static-graph, docs, and package-CLI coverage.

Open issues / next step
- No known blocking issues remain from the reviewer feedback I was asked to address.
- The next step is verifier re-review against the updated phase artifacts and targeted regression surface.

I’m re-reviewing the two addressed findings plus the adjacent phase-1 surfaces they touched. I’ll verify the `Prompt.ref(...)` semantics fix, confirm the docs no longer publish legacy primary examples, then update the phase criteria and feedback accordingly.

There’s still one more public legacy example lower in `docs/authoring.md` around line 440. I’m checking whether it’s framed as compatibility-only or if it still violates the “canonical public guidance” requirement before I close the review.

The code-path fix for `Prompt.ref(...)` is solid and the targeted tests are green. The remaining gap is narrower now: `docs/authoring.md` still has a couple of legacy public examples (`Prompt("...")` and a `PairStep` worklist snippet) that keep AC-5 from being complete.

Scope considered
- Phase `canonical-surface-and-topology-lowering` only.
- I re-reviewed the addressed reviewer findings plus adjacent phase-1 validation and public-doc surfaces.
- I did not expand into unrelated dirty files outside this phase scope.

What I analyzed
- The current phase feedback and criteria artifacts.
- The `Prompt.ref(...)` compile-time path in `core/validation.py`.
- The revised examples in `docs/authoring.md`.
- The new regression coverage in `tests/unit/test_simple_surface.py`.
- The targeted validation run reported by the implementer and re-run here.

What I reviewed
- `IMP-001`: registry-prompt compile/runtime semantics drift.
- `IMP-002`: migration of public docs/examples to the canonical phase-1 surface.
- Adjacent AC-5 doc/example surfaces to ensure no remaining legacy primary examples were left behind.
- Targeted tests: `70` passed.

Key findings / decisions
- `IMP-001` is resolved. The compile-time prompt analysis now preserves `Prompt.ref(...)` registry semantics, and the new regression test covers the collision case.
- I found one remaining blocking doc gap and appended it as `IMP-003` in the phase feedback.
- `docs/authoring.md` still contains legacy public examples at the prompt-resolution snippet (`Prompt("prompts/ask.md")`) and the worklist/scoped-step snippet (`PairStep(...)`). Because those are still primary public examples rather than compatibility-only material, AC-5 is not complete yet.
- I left the criteria unchecked because a blocking finding remains.

Open issues / next step
- Rewrite the remaining legacy examples in `docs/authoring.md` to `Prompt.file(...)` and `step(...)` / `do_review_step(...)` with `scope=...`, or move them into a clearly labeled compatibility-only section.
- After that, re-run the same targeted doc/simple-surface test slice and re-review for completion.

I’m narrowing this to the last reviewer complaint: the remaining legacy examples in `docs/authoring.md`. Before editing, I’m checking whether the simple surface already exposes `scope=`; if it doesn’t, I’ll rewrite the worklist example to the nearest canonical phase-1 surface without inventing out-of-scope API.

The worklist example can’t be truthfully rewritten onto the simple surface today because `autoloop.simple` still doesn’t expose `scope=` in this phase. I’m fixing the prompt example to `Prompt.file(...)` and explicitly fencing the scoped `PairStep` snippet as an advanced compatibility example instead of leaving it as unqualified public guidance.

I’ve made the remaining doc changes. I’m running the doc-facing checks and a quick search over `docs/authoring.md` so I can verify the legacy examples are either canonicalized or explicitly compatibility-fenced, not accidentally still presented as greenfield guidance.

The remaining doc fix is intentionally narrow: I’m recording that the worklist/scoped-step snippet stays compatibility-fenced because `autoloop.simple` still doesn’t expose a canonical `scope=` declaration in this phase. That keeps the guidance honest without inventing new API surface.

Scope considered
- Phase `canonical-surface-and-topology-lowering` only.
- I addressed the remaining reviewer finding in `docs/authoring.md`.
- I did not broaden scope beyond the doc surface and the related phase tests.

What I analyzed
- The reviewer’s remaining blocking note in the phase feedback.
- The residual legacy examples in [docs/authoring.md](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/docs/authoring.md), especially the prompt-resolution snippet and the worklist/scoped-step snippet.
- Whether the canonical simple surface already exposes a documented `scope=` declaration in this phase.

What I changed
- I changed the prompt-resolution example in [docs/authoring.md](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/docs/authoring.md) from `Prompt("prompts/ask.md")` to `Prompt.file("prompts/ask.md")`.
- I explicitly fenced the scoped `PairStep(...)` worklist example in the same doc as advanced compatibility guidance instead of leaving it presented as greenfield canonical surface usage.
- I updated [implementation_notes.md](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/implement/phases/canonical-surface-and-topology-lowering/implementation_notes.md) and appended the corresponding constraint under the current turn header in [decisions.txt](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/decisions.txt).

Key findings / decisions
- I did not invent a new simple-surface `scope=` API, because that would be an out-of-phase behavior change.
- The worklist/scoped-step snippet now stays honest: it remains documented, but clearly as compatibility guidance for the stricter surface rather than canonical phase-1 simple authoring.
- Validation passed again after the doc fix: `70` targeted tests passed.

Open issues / next step
- No known implement-side issues remain from the active reviewer feedback.
- The next step is verifier re-review of the updated phase artifacts and doc surface.

I’m doing the final phase re-review now. I’ll verify the last doc change against the reviewer note, confirm the phase criteria are fully met, then update the phase artifacts to a complete state if nothing else is outstanding.

The remaining doc example is now clearly compatibility-fenced, which matches the phase decision and no longer contradicts the canonical greenfield guidance. I’m marking the phase complete and appending a final review note so the feedback ledger reflects that the earlier blockers are resolved, not still active.

Scope considered
- Phase `canonical-surface-and-topology-lowering` only.
- I re-reviewed the latest doc changes, the phase decisions, and the acceptance-criteria surface affected by the earlier blockers.
- I did not expand into unrelated dirty files outside this phase scope.

What I analyzed
- The current phase feedback and criteria artifacts.
- The updated public examples in `docs/authoring.md`, especially the prompt-resolution snippet and the scoped worklist snippet.
- The shared decisions ledger to confirm the compatibility-fenced worklist example is consistent with the documented phase boundary.
- The targeted validation status already recorded for this cycle.

What I reviewed
- `IMP-001`: already resolved in cycle 2 and still consistent.
- `IMP-002` / `IMP-003`: now resolved by canonicalizing the prompt example and explicitly fencing the scoped `PairStep(...)` snippet as compatibility guidance.
- AC-1 through AC-5 against the current implementation and public guidance surface.

Key findings / decisions
- No blocking findings remain.
- The remaining legacy scoped worklist example is now clearly labeled as compatibility guidance, which is consistent with the phase decision that the canonical simple surface does not yet document `scope=`.
- I marked all criteria as complete and appended a final review note to the phase feedback reflecting that the earlier blockers are resolved.

Open issues / next step
- No open blocking issues remain for this phase.
- The phase is ready to be treated as complete and handed off to the next planned slice.

I’m treating this as a regression-hardening pass for the completed phase. First I’m checking the existing test strategy and feedback artifacts, then I’ll add narrowly targeted coverage for the remaining high-risk regressions on the docs and canonical-surface guidance.

I found a narrow gap in the current test layer: the docs baseline tests don’t lock the last review fix, so a future edit could quietly reintroduce `Prompt("...")` or remove the compatibility fence while still passing. I’m adding one focused doc regression test rather than broadening the suite.

The new coverage is in place. I’m running the docs baseline test file plus the existing phase-targeted slice so the strategy and feedback I record are grounded in a clean pass, not just static inspection.

The targeted slice is green. I’m recording the coverage map now, with one explicit note that the doc tests pin the last compatibility-fence decision so the public examples can’t drift back to mixed guidance without a test failure.

Scope considered
- Phase `canonical-surface-and-topology-lowering` only.
- I focused on the remaining regression risk around canonical public docs/examples and the already-changed simple-surface behavior.
- I did not broaden into unrelated test churn.

What I analyzed
- The current phase tests in `tests/test_architecture_baseline_docs.py`, `tests/unit/test_simple_surface.py`, `tests/runtime/test_runtime_static_graph.py`, and `tests/runtime/test_package_cli.py`.
- The final implementation decision that keeps scoped worklist guidance compatibility-fenced because simple-surface `scope=` is not yet documented in this phase.
- The active test artifacts: `test_strategy.md`, `feedback.md`, and the current turn header in `decisions.txt`.

What I changed
- I added a focused docs regression test in [tests/test_architecture_baseline_docs.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/tests/test_architecture_baseline_docs.py) that:
  - requires `Prompt.file("prompts/ask.md")` in the public authoring doc,
  - forbids the legacy `Prompt("...")` example,
  - requires the scoped `PairStep(...)` worklist example to remain explicitly compatibility-fenced.
- I updated [test_strategy.md](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/test/phases/canonical-surface-and-topology-lowering/test_strategy.md) with a concise behavior-to-test coverage map for AC-1 through AC-5, preserved invariants, edge cases, failure paths, and known gaps.
- I appended a concise summary entry to [feedback.md](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/test/phases/canonical-surface-and-topology-lowering/feedback.md).
- I appended the non-obvious docs-boundary test decision under the current turn header in [decisions.txt](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/decisions.txt).

Key findings / decisions
- The highest-value remaining regression was on documentation drift, not runtime behavior.
- I kept the new coverage narrow and deterministic: it locks the final doc-state that the verifier required without normalizing any out-of-scope API like simple-surface `scope=`.
- Targeted validation passed: `71` tests passed across the phase doc/simple-surface/topology/package-CLI slice.

Open issues / next step
- No test-author blocker remains for this phase.
- The next step is test-phase verification/audit against the updated strategy and feedback artifacts.

I’m auditing the phase test layer now. I’ll verify that the new docs regression test and the broader coverage map actually protect the changed phase-1 behavior, then I’ll update the test audit artifacts to complete state if no material gaps remain.

The test layer is in good shape: the new doc test is deterministic, targeted, and actually closes the last regression seam from the implementation review. I’m marking the audit complete and appending a final audit note so the feedback file reflects that there are no remaining test-layer blockers.

Scope considered
- Phase `canonical-surface-and-topology-lowering` test layer only.
- I audited the active test artifacts plus the phase-relevant tests that were added or relied on for this slice.
- I did not expand into unrelated repository code or non-phase test churn.

What I analyzed
- The test audit artifacts: `criteria.md`, `feedback.md`, and `test_strategy.md`.
- The changed phase-relevant tests in `tests/test_architecture_baseline_docs.py`, `tests/unit/test_simple_surface.py`, `tests/runtime/test_runtime_static_graph.py`, and `tests/runtime/test_package_cli.py`.
- The shared decisions that define the allowed compatibility seam around the scoped `PairStep(...)` doc example.

What I reviewed
- Coverage quality for AC-1 through AC-5.
- Regression protection for the `Prompt.ref(...)` compile-time collision case and the final docs-boundary drift case.
- Failure-path and edge-case coverage for unknown/ambiguous placeholders and registry-vs-filesystem prompt resolution.
- Reliability of the new docs regression test and the temp-module setup used by the prompt-ref regression test.

Key findings / decisions
- No blocking test findings remain.
- The added docs regression test closes the last meaningful gap by pinning the canonical `Prompt.file(...)` example and the explicit compatibility fence around the scoped `PairStep(...)` snippet.
- The overall phase test slice is deterministic and appropriate for the changed behavior; it does not encode an unconfirmed regression or behavior break.
- I marked all test audit criteria complete and appended a final audit note to the phase feedback.

Open issues / next step
- No open test-audit blockers remain for this phase.
- The test phase is ready to be treated as complete.

I’m implementing the `do_review_step` phase scope in the existing FSM lowering path. First I’m reading the active phase artifacts and the current workflow/review-step code to find the narrowest safe change surface.

I’ve confirmed the phase scope is narrowly about `do_review_step`, separate do/review contracts, and route-scoped required writes. Next I’m tracing the current `PairStep` lowering, route validation, and provider contract code so the change stays additive to the existing engine.

I’ve found the main seams: `autoloop.simple` declarations lower into `PairStep`, `core.validation` injects routes and required outputs, and `core.compiler` still models pair steps as one producer/verifier contract. I’m reading the lower-half helpers now to see where to add separate review prompts, review artifacts, and route-specific required-write normalization without widening the engine unnecessarily.

The current surface already has a minimal `do_review_step` alias, but it still collapses everything into one `PairStep`: one `requires`, one `writes`, one `session`, and one provider control contract reused for both turns. I’m now mapping where to thread separate do/review metadata through compilation and runtime payloads, and I’ll keep the engine’s step loop intact.

Plan for the code change:
1. Extend the simple review declaration surface so `do_review_step` can carry `routes`, `review_requires`, `review_writes`, and `review_session`, while keeping `review_step` and `producer`/`verifier` compatibility.
2. Thread that metadata through `PairStep`, validation, and compilation, including the important `required_writes=None` vs `required_writes=[]` distinction for route overrides.
3. Split pair-step runtime/provider contracts so the do phase and review phase see different required/writable artifacts and optional review-session handling, then add focused unit/contract/runtime tests.

I’ve pinned the main semantic gap: route metadata currently collapses “no explicit override” and “explicitly no required writes” into the same empty tuple. I’m fixing that first because selected-route validation for review steps depends on it.

I’m editing the lowering path now. The review declaration needs to carry separate review-only metadata all the way through discovery and validation before the runtime split can use it safely.

The next edit is the runtime seam: pair steps still build one shared contract and one shared writable set. I’m splitting that into producer and verifier contracts while leaving the outer retry loop and checkpointing flow in place.

The structural edits are in. I’m running a fast compile check on the touched modules before adding tests so I can catch any lowering/runtime mismatches early.

I’m in the verification pass now. First I’m running the targeted unit and contract tests that exercise the new lowering rules, explicit empty `required_writes`, and the split pair-step provider contracts.

The test process is still running. I’ve got the first pass underway and I’m waiting for the full failure list before making the next correction set.

I hit two categories of failures: expected ones from tests that still assert the old pair-step contract, and one real regression in simple default-route merging where generated defaults were colliding with explicit transitions. I’m fixing the merge rule so explicit transitions win over injected defaults, then I’ll update the stale contract assertions.

The focused phase tests are green. I’m doing one more regression sweep over adjacent provider-boundary and compatibility tests because the runtime contract shape changed for pair steps.

The code is stable under the targeted tests now. I’m recording the phase-specific non-obvious decisions in the task ledger and implementation notes so later turns don’t silently drift on the pair-step contract split or the explicit-empty `required_writes` behavior.

I’ve finished the code and test work. I’m doing one last cleanup pass on generated bytecode artifacts from the test/compile run so the diff only contains the intentional source and note changes.

**Scope considered**
- Active phase only: `do_review_step` canonical surface, pair-step do/review contract split, route-specific `required_writes`, and adjacent lowering/runtime regression surfaces.
- I avoided pulling unrelated dirty files into scope.

**What I analyzed**
- The simple-surface lowering path in [autoloop/simple.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/autoloop/simple.py).
- Pair-step/runtime metadata flow in [core/steps.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/core/steps.py), [core/validation.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/core/validation.py), [core/compiler.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/core/compiler.py), and [core/engine.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/core/engine.py).
- Topology/report payloads in [runtime/static_graph.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/runtime/static_graph.py).
- Existing contract coverage in [tests/unit/test_simple_surface.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/tests/unit/test_simple_surface.py), [tests/unit/test_validation.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/tests/unit/test_validation.py), and [tests/contract/test_engine_contracts.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/tests/contract/test_engine_contracts.py).

**What I changed**
- Extended `do_review_step`/`review_step` declarations to accept `review_requires`, `review_writes`, `routes`, and `review_session`, while keeping `producer`/`verifier` compatibility.
- Extended `PairStep` and compiled metadata with phase-specific review metadata and kept final artifact validation centralized on the combined artifact union.
- Split pair-step provider contracts:
  - producer turn now gets do-phase reads/requires/writes only;
  - verifier turn gets review-phase requires/writes plus route-required-write metadata.
- Fixed the `required_writes=None` vs `required_writes=[]` distinction so an explicit empty override suppresses artifact-level required defaults.
- Fixed injected simple default routes so they no longer conflict with explicit workflow transitions.
- Added additive topology fields for do/review metadata and added targeted tests for the new behavior.

**Key findings / decisions**
- The lowest-risk implementation was to keep one compiled artifact set for pair steps and add phase-specific write metadata around it, rather than creating a second validation path.
- Producer-turn route metadata had to be intentionally removed from the provider contract to satisfy the requested do/review split.
- Phase-specific do/review lifecycle hooks were left out of this slice; the existing shared hook surface remains in place.

**Open issues / next step**
- No blocking issues in this phase.

I’m reviewing the phase diff against the active scope and acceptance criteria first, then I’ll write findings and mark the verifier artifacts accordingly. I’m focusing on the changed pair-step lowering/runtime paths and their adjacent compatibility surfaces.

The repo’s VCS state is unusual here, so I’m reading the live source directly rather than relying on `git diff`. I’m checking the simple declaration surface, pair-step compiler/runtime path, and a couple of compatibility/regression hotspots by file.

I’ve narrowed the remaining review to the compiled-step and runtime execution path so I can verify the pair-step contract split and required-write enforcement end to end before I mark criteria.

I’ve confirmed the compiler carries the new phase-specific fields. I’m opening the pair-step execution helpers next because that’s where any hidden regression or contract mismatch would show up.

The runtime path looks structurally consistent so far. I’m checking the phase artifacts now and then I’ll decide whether there’s any blocker significant enough to keep the phase open.

I haven’t found a material correctness gap in the code path yet. I’m running the phase-focused tests directly now so the review can be based on fresh validation rather than only the producer notes.

The test run is still active. While it finishes, the current review status is that the phase implementation appears internally consistent and the main remaining check is empirical regression coverage.

I’ve completed the test-backed review. There are no blocking findings for this phase, so I’m updating the verifier artifacts to reflect a complete pass with explicit validation notes.

Scope considered

Active phase only: `do-review-step-and-route-required-writes`, covering the simple declaration surface, lowering/validation, compiled metadata, pair-step runtime execution, provider-facing contracts, static graph payloads, and the phase-owned verifier artifacts.

What I analyzed

I reviewed the authoritative phase artifacts, the shared decisions ledger, and the request/acceptance criteria. In code, I traced the implementation through [autoloop/simple.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/autoloop/simple.py), [core/steps.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/core/steps.py), [core/validation.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/core/validation.py), [core/compiler.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/core/compiler.py), [core/engine.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/core/engine.py), and [runtime/static_graph.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/runtime/static_graph.py), plus the targeted test coverage added in the touched test files.

What I reviewed

I checked that `do_review_step` preserves `review_step` compatibility while adding separate do/review prompts, writes, requires, and review session metadata; that route-level `required_writes` normalize across the combined pair-step artifact inventory; that explicit `required_writes=[]` suppresses artifact-level defaults only when intentionally specified; and that producer/verifier contracts are split without breaking the existing compiled FSM model. I also ran the phase-focused regression suite directly:
`./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/unit/test_simple_surface.py tests/unit/test_validation.py tests/contract/test_engine_contracts.py tests/runtime/test_runtime_static_graph.py tests/unit/test_provider_boundary_core.py tests/runtime/test_compatibility_runtime.py -q`
Result: `257 passed`.

Key findings / decisions

No blocking or non-blocking findings. The implementation satisfies the active phase contract and acceptance criteria, and the verifier artifacts were updated accordingly in [criteria.md](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/implement/phases/do-review-step-and-route-required-writes/criteria.md) and [feedback.md](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/implement/phases/do-review-step-and-route-required-writes/feedback.md).

Open issues / next step

No open issues for this phase. The phase can proceed as complete.

I’m checking the phase’s existing test coverage and the test-phase artifacts first, then I’ll add any missing regression tests and update the phase strategy and feedback.

The current tests cover the declaration surface and contract split well. I’m looking for runtime gaps now, especially around `review_session` behavior, because that’s the part most likely to regress without a direct test.

I found two concrete runtime gaps worth pinning down in tests: the explicit `review_session` override path, and the strict runtime path where `review_requires` intentionally forces the verifier to stop before review if the do artifact is missing.

I’ve chosen two additive contract tests: one to lock down the `review_session` runtime split, and one to lock down the strict `review_requires` failure path. Both are deterministic and hit the highest-risk regression surfaces left uncovered.

The new tests are in place. I’m running the affected contract file now to catch any mismatch in the session-binding assertions or the strict `review_requires` failure path.

The contract suite passed cleanly. I’m doing a quick pass over the updated phase artifacts and then I’ll close this turn with the coverage summary and validation result.

I’m tightening one assertion in the new session test so it’s less self-referential and easier to read if it ever fails.

The assertion cleanup didn’t change behavior; the contract suite is still green. I’m wrapping up with the phase summary and the files I updated.

Scope considered

Active phase only: `do-review-step-and-route-required-writes`, focused on request-relevant regression coverage for `do_review_step`, split do/review contracts, `review_requires`, `review_session`, and route-specific `required_writes`.

What I analyzed

I reviewed the active phase contract, the shared decisions ledger, the current phase artifacts, and the existing test coverage in [tests/unit/test_simple_surface.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/tests/unit/test_simple_surface.py), [tests/unit/test_validation.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/tests/unit/test_validation.py), and [tests/contract/test_engine_contracts.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/tests/contract/test_engine_contracts.py). I specifically checked for runtime gaps that were not already covered by the implementation-phase tests.

What I changed

I added two contract tests in [tests/contract/test_engine_contracts.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/tests/contract/test_engine_contracts.py):
- `test_do_review_step_review_session_override_uses_distinct_verifier_session_slot`
- `test_do_review_step_review_requires_fail_before_verifier_when_declared`

I also updated [test_strategy.md](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/test/phases/do-review-step-and-route-required-writes/test_strategy.md) with an explicit behavior-to-coverage map, appended a concise summary to [feedback.md](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/test/phases/do-review-step-and-route-required-writes/feedback.md), and recorded the non-obvious test coverage decisions under the current turn header in [decisions.txt](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/decisions.txt).

Key findings / decisions

The main uncovered regression surfaces were runtime-only:
- `review_session` needed a direct contract test to prove producer and verifier persist separate session slots.
- `review_requires` needed a strict failure-path test to prove the verifier is skipped when the author explicitly requires a missing do artifact.

Validation run:
- `./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/contract/test_engine_contracts.py -q`
- Result: `84 passed in 0.83s`

Open issues / next step

No open issues in this phase’s test scope. Phase-specific hook lifecycle coverage remains intentionally deferred to the later hook/state phase.

I’m auditing the new test coverage against the phase acceptance criteria and the runtime behaviors it’s meant to pin down, starting with the added contract tests and the updated phase artifacts.

I’m checking the new failure-path assertions in full before I mark criteria. The key question is whether the tests would actually catch the regression, not just execute the happy path.

The new assertions are meaningful: the strict path proves the verifier is skipped, and the session test proves the override is actually persisted. I’m running the phase-relevant test slice now to confirm the coverage holds together.

The phase-relevant slice is still running. So far it’s clean, and I haven’t found a coverage gap that rises to a blocking audit finding.

The targeted test slice passed. I’m updating the audit artifacts now to mark the phase complete and record that there are no blocking or non-blocking coverage findings.

Scope considered

Active test phase only: `do-review-step-and-route-required-writes`, focused on the new contract/runtime coverage for `do_review_step`, `review_requires`, `review_session`, and route-specific `required_writes`, plus the phase-owned audit artifacts.

What I analyzed

I reviewed the added tests in [tests/contract/test_engine_contracts.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/tests/contract/test_engine_contracts.py), the existing adjacent coverage in [tests/unit/test_simple_surface.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/tests/unit/test_simple_surface.py) and [tests/unit/test_validation.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/tests/unit/test_validation.py), the updated [test_strategy.md](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/test/phases/do-review-step-and-route-required-writes/test_strategy.md), and the shared decisions for this phase.

What I reviewed

I checked that the new tests cover the material runtime gaps left after implementation: separate verifier session-slot behavior when `review_session` is declared, and the strict failure path where declared `review_requires` should stop before verifier execution. I also verified that the broader phase slice still passes:
`./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/unit/test_simple_surface.py tests/unit/test_validation.py tests/contract/test_engine_contracts.py -q`
Result: `204 passed in 1.27s`.

Key findings / decisions

No blocking or non-blocking audit findings. The added tests materially improve regression protection for AC-1 and AC-2, the preserved explicit-empty-override invariant remains covered, and the strategy/feedback artifacts now accurately describe the behavior-to-test map and validation outcome.

Open issues / next step

No open issues in this phase’s test scope. The audit artifacts were updated in [criteria.md](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/test/phases/do-review-step-and-route-required-writes/criteria.md) and [feedback.md](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/test/phases/do-review-step-and-route-required-writes/feedback.md).

I’m working within the active `hook-state-session-and-topology-metadata` phase. First I’m reading the phase artifacts, shared decisions, and the existing workflow/compiler/runtime code paths that were changed by the prior phases so I can scope the implementation against the current contracts before editing.

The active phase feedback file is effectively empty, so I’m treating the phase contract and shared decisions as the governing spec. Next I’m reading the current compiler, engine, context, and public-surface modules to find the narrowest extension points for hooks, state descriptors, session persistence, prompt namespaces, and resume guards.

I’ve confirmed the current runtime still centers on `before`/`after` hooks, legacy after-hook route override support, and checkpoint-only resume without any topology hash guard. I’m drilling into the step execution and checkpoint serialization paths now, because that’s where this phase’s contract actually lands or regresses.

I’ve found the main deltas cleanly: there is no descriptor-backed workflow state or params surface yet, route hooks only exist as metadata and are never executed, after hooks still support route redirection, and topology artifacts don’t include hashes or resume validation. I’m reading the tracing and run-metadata writers now so I can wire the new compile metadata through one path instead of scattering it across runtime code.

Plan for this phase:

1. Add descriptor-backed public surfaces.
   `StateVar` and `Param` will synthesize effective workflow state and params models without removing existing `State` and `Parameters` compatibility paths.

2. Extend declarations, compilation, and runtime metadata.
   I’m wiring `on_route`, route `on_taken`, review lifecycle hooks, default/global session metadata, and topology/source hashes through the existing lowering path rather than adding a second execution model.

3. Rework hook execution around the requested contract.
   Hooks will execute in the specified order, emit observable hook events, mutate state/session/artifacts through context, and no longer redirect routes through after-hook return values.

4. Persist the new runtime state safely.
   Step/item/step-item state plus deterministic global-session changes will be checkpointed and restored, then resume will reject topology-hash mismatches.

5. Expand prompt-ref validation and topology artifacts, then add phase-targeted tests.
   I’ll cover the new placeholder namespaces, reserved pseudo-fields, hook order/failure behavior, session reset persistence, and resume mismatch handling.

I’ve got enough context to start editing. I’m first adding the reusable descriptor and model-synthesis layer so the workflow/compiler/runtime changes all share one implementation for `StateVar`, `Param`, and step-state defaults instead of duplicating that logic in multiple modules.

I’m editing the core step/session declarations next. This is where I need to add the new hook slots and global-session semantics without changing the compiled FSM shape underneath.

I’m in the compiler/validation layer now. I need this slice to do three things together: synthesize effective models from descriptors, validate the new prompt namespaces against those models, and carry the extra hook/session metadata forward without changing execution yet.

I’m editing the runtime `Context` surface now. This is the most coupled part of the phase because the hook/session/state changes all become user-visible here, and I need to keep the existing handler APIs working while adding the new surfaces.

I’ve finished the declaration/model layer and I’m moving into persistence and execution. The next edits extend checkpoint payloads and the engine loop together, because step/item state and route hooks only make sense if they survive pause/resume exactly.

I’ve finished the descriptor and declaration layer and I’m closing the runtime gap now. The next pass is `core/engine.py`, then run metadata and resume guards, then targeted tests and phase notes.

I’ve confirmed the incomplete area: the engine already has the new call sites wired in, but the route-phase hooks and checkpoint wiring still need to be finished coherently. I’m reading the remaining helper section now so I can patch the engine in one pass instead of layering partial fixes.

The runtime context surface is already in place, which is helpful; the remaining work is mostly enforcing the new semantics consistently. I’m checking the existing hook and resume tests now so I can update the minimum necessary cases rather than churn unrelated coverage.

I’m patching the engine now. This pass removes the remaining legacy hook-override behavior, makes route hooks actually run, persists the new state stores in checkpoints, and wires hook events into the runtime sink.

The engine patch is in, but I spotted one default-initialization edge case for step state that I want to tighten before I run tests. After that I’ll patch the runtime metadata layer and resume guard together.

I’ve isolated the one bad branch in step-state defaulting. I’m correcting that and loosening after-hook arity so the new ctx-only style works consistently instead of being blocked by legacy validation rules.

I’m splitting topology handling into two parts: a pre-run resume guard, and metadata persistence after topology artifacts are written. That avoids the bad case where a resumed run would overwrite its old hash before the mismatch check happens.

The runtime now has a path to persist topology metadata and emit hook events. I’m expanding the topology artifacts next so the stored metadata and the on-disk topology files line up instead of telling two different stories.

I found an important regression surface: there are already legacy hook tests in the contract suite that assume route overrides. I’m reviewing those next so I can update the behavior intentionally instead of letting the suite fail in a noisy way.

I’m replacing the legacy hook-override tests with the new contract tests now. That keeps the suite aligned with the deliberate behavior break instead of carrying two incompatible hook models at once.

The contract suite is aligned with the new hook semantics now. I’m adding targeted public-surface tests for `StateVar`/`Param` next so the new descriptor path is covered without depending only on runtime integration.

I’ve reached the validation pass. I’m running the focused suites that cover the changed surfaces first: contract hooks, simple-surface descriptors, static topology artifacts, and runtime resume metadata.

The repo doesn’t have a plain `pytest` entrypoint in PATH here. I’m switching to the project interpreter path (`python3 -m pytest`) and, if needed, the local venv runner, so I can still get real test results instead of stopping at compile-only validation.

The unit and runtime metadata suites are moving cleanly. I still need the hook contract slice from `tests/contract/test_engine_contracts.py`, because that’s where the intentional route-override removal will show if anything is still inconsistent.

The new tests exposed three simple-surface expectation drifts: one state default assertion, one legacy strict-validation expectation, and one helper signature snapshot. I’m fixing those expectations first, then I’ll read the remaining contract failures from the hook runtime slice.

I’ve adjusted the remaining expectation drift around default-session activation. I’m rerunning the focused failures first, then the full contract file again to make sure there isn’t a second-order break hiding behind those updates.

The broad rerun is almost clean. There’s one remaining unit-level helper-signature drift, and the combined runtime/contract pass is still running; I’m pulling both outputs now so I can finish the last adjustment instead of guessing.

The code and focused tests are clean now. I’m doing the phase bookkeeping next: recording the non-obvious implementation decisions and updating the phase notes with the exact scope, files, invariants, and validation that landed.

I’m recording the two non-obvious choices from this phase: the exact hook compatibility break, and where the resume topology guard lives relative to metadata writes. Then I’ll close the phase notes with the files, invariants, and validation.

Scope considered

Active phase `hook-state-session-and-topology-metadata` only. I stayed on the hook/state/session/topology surface and ignored unrelated dirty files in the worktree.

What I analyzed

`core/validation.py`, `core/compiler.py`, `core/context.py`, `core/engine.py`, checkpoint/session stores, `runtime/runner.py`, `runtime/static_graph.py`, `runtime/workspace.py`, and the existing hook/resume/static-graph tests. I also checked the phase artifacts, plan, and decisions ledger before editing.

What I changed

Added descriptor-backed `StateVar`/`Param` support and threaded the merged workflow state/parameter models through validation, compilation, loader resolution, and the public exports.

Extended the simple/public declarations and compiled step metadata for `on_route`, route `on_taken`, pair-step lifecycle hooks, step-local state declarations, and `Session(open=...)`.

Expanded `Context` with `artifacts`, `values`, `route`, `outcome`, `meta`, `step_state`, `item_state`, `step_item_state`, plus IO and global-session helpers. Checkpoints now persist step/item/step-item state stores.

Finished the engine hook contract: hooks execute in order, emit observable hook events, mutate state/artifacts/session through the new context, and no longer redirect routes. `on_route` and route `on_taken` now run before final required-write validation.

Added topology/source hash support to compiled workflows and topology artifacts, persisted topology metadata into `run.json`, and made resume fail clearly when the saved topology hash differs.

Key findings / decisions

Hook-based route overrides were intentionally retired in this phase. `after*` hooks can update state only; post-route policy now belongs in `on_route` or route `on_taken`.

Resume mismatch guarding has to run before a resumed segment rewrites topology metadata. I enforced that in both the filesystem runner and direct `Engine.resume(...)` path.

Targeted validation passed:
`./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/unit/test_simple_surface.py -q`
`./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/runtime/test_runtime_static_graph.py tests/runtime/test_workspace_and_context.py tests/contract/test_engine_contracts.py -q`

Open issues / next step

No open blockers in this phase scope. I did not run the full repository test suite; the next phase should build on this with the feedforward `llm()` / `classify()` work and then do a broader regression pass.

I’m reviewing the active phase against the implemented code and the acceptance criteria first. I’ll verify the touched runtime/compiler paths, then update the phase criteria and feedback artifacts with any concrete findings.

I found one material correctness bug in the hook lifecycle and I’m verifying whether there’s a second issue worth escalating. The first one is in the route-hook sequencing: state-dependent artifact paths are not refreshed between `on_route` and `on_taken`, which can make the second hook write to stale locations and then fail final validation.

Reviewing the phase artifacts and the implementation diff now. I’ve isolated one concrete engine regression in the new hook lifecycle and I’m updating the verifier artifacts with that finding.

I’ve confirmed the phase criteria file is still blank and the feedback file is empty. I’m appending the blocking finding now and leaving the criteria unchecked because the hook lifecycle is not behaviorally safe yet.

The feedback artifact now has the blocking engine finding. I’m not adding approvals to `criteria.md`; with that regression present, the phase cannot be marked correct or behaviorally safe.

Scope considered

Phase-local verifier scope for `hook-state-session-and-topology-metadata`. I reviewed the implementation diff and phase artifacts needed to assess hook/state/session/topology behavior, and only updated the active verifier artifacts under `.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/`.

What I analyzed

`core/engine.py` hook finalization flow, `core/context.py` session helpers, `core/validation.py` prompt namespace validation, the active `implementation_notes.md`, and the phase criteria/feedback artifacts. I also checked the decisions ledger for conflicting prior direction and found none that changed the reviewer conclusion.

What I reviewed

The main regression is in `core/engine.py:_finalize_step_result`: route hooks share a single precomputed artifact binding, so `on_route` state changes that alter artifact paths are not reflected before `on_taken` runs. I updated [feedback.md](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/implement/phases/hook-state-session-and-topology-metadata/feedback.md) with a blocking finding and left [criteria.md](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/implement/phases/hook-state-session-and-topology-metadata/criteria.md) unchecked because the phase is not yet behaviorally safe.

Key findings / decisions

`IMP-001` is blocking. The new hook contract allows `on_route` to mutate state, but the engine does not re-resolve and rebind artifacts before the route-level `on_taken` hook. That can direct healing/writes to stale paths and then fail final required-write validation against the newly derived path. The minimal fix is to refresh artifact resolution after each successful route hook inside `_finalize_step_result`.

Open issues / next step

Implement the `IMP-001` fix in the engine, then rerun the targeted hook/state/session tests and re-review the phase artifacts.

The reviewer surfaced a concrete engine bug in the new route-hook lifecycle. I’m tracing that path and the adjacent context/artifact resolution code first, then I’ll patch the smallest safe fix and update the phase notes.

I’ve confirmed the failure mode in `_finalize_step_result`. Next I’m checking the hook helper and existing contract tests so the fix stays centralized and I can add one regression test for state-derived artifact paths across `on_route` and `on_taken`.

I have the minimal safe fix: re-resolve and rebind artifacts after `on_route` and again after `on_taken`, so each route hook sees the current state-derived artifact surface. I’m patching that path and adding a regression test that fails on the old behavior.

The code path is patched. I’m running the focused contract tests around route hooks and artifact validation now, then I’ll fold the reviewer-driven change into the phase notes and decision ledger.

The new regression test is close but I targeted the wrong artifact root. I’m locating the actual resolved path that the workflow uses for this artifact and then I’ll lock the test to that path before rerunning.

The hook fix itself is working; the failed assertion was just using the wrong expected directory. I’m correcting the regression test to match the artifact template’s actual `{workflow_folder}` resolution and rerunning the focused suite.

The focused regression tests are green. I’m doing one broader pass over the full engine contract suite now because the change sits on a central execution path and I want to catch any ordering or validation regressions before I close the loop.

I’ve validated the fix across the full engine contract suite. I’m updating the phase notes and the shared decision block now so later turns preserve the refreshed artifact-binding rule between route hooks.

Scope considered

Phase-local work for `hook-state-session-and-topology-metadata`, limited to the reviewer-reported route-hook artifact-binding regression and its adjacent engine/test/note surfaces.

What I analyzed

I traced `core/engine.py:_finalize_step_result` and `Engine._run_route_hook`, checked the active [feedback.md](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/implement/phases/hook-state-session-and-topology-metadata/feedback.md), and reviewed the existing hook/required-write contract coverage in [tests/contract/test_engine_contracts.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/tests/contract/test_engine_contracts.py).

What I changed

I patched [core/engine.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/core/engine.py) so `_finalize_step_result` re-resolves and rebinds artifacts immediately after `on_route` and again after route-level `on_taken`. That keeps `ctx.artifacts` aligned with any state-derived path changes before the next hook or final required-write validation runs.

I added a regression test in [tests/contract/test_engine_contracts.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/tests/contract/test_engine_contracts.py) that mutates state in `on_route`, writes the required artifact in `on_taken`, and asserts the write lands at the refreshed path instead of the stale one. I also updated [implementation_notes.md](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/implement/phases/hook-state-session-and-topology-metadata/implementation_notes.md) and appended the non-obvious rule to [decisions.txt](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/decisions.txt).

Key findings / decisions

The bug was real: the old code passed one precomputed `finalized_artifacts` binding through both route hooks, so `on_taken` could observe stale paths after `on_route` mutated state. The fix stays localized in `_finalize_step_result` rather than adding a new abstraction.

Validation passed:
`python3 -m py_compile core/engine.py tests/contract/test_engine_contracts.py`
`./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/contract/test_engine_contracts.py -q`
`./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/contract/test_engine_contracts.py -q -k "route_hook or on_route_hook_runs_before_required_output_validation or after_hook_state_mutation_re_resolves_artifact_paths_before_final_output_validation"`
`./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/runtime/test_workspace_and_context.py -q`

Open issues / next step

No open blocker remains from `IMP-001`. The phase is ready for verifier rerun.

Re-reviewing the phase after the producer fix. I’m checking the updated route-hook engine path, the new regression test, and the phase artifacts, then I’ll either clear the phase or record any remaining issue.

The producer’s fix addresses the original failure mode and the new regression test covers it directly. I’m marking the criteria complete and annotating the feedback artifact so the original blocking finding is clearly recorded as resolved rather than still open.

Scope considered

Phase-local verifier scope for `hook-state-session-and-topology-metadata`. I re-reviewed the producer’s cycle-2 fix for the route-hook artifact-binding bug and the phase artifacts only.

What I analyzed

I checked the updated route-hook finalization path in [core/engine.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/core/engine.py:1070), the new regression coverage in [tests/contract/test_engine_contracts.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/tests/contract/test_engine_contracts.py:3999), the updated [implementation_notes.md](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/implement/phases/hook-state-session-and-topology-metadata/implementation_notes.md), and the shared decision appended for this turn in [decisions.txt](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/decisions.txt).

What I reviewed

The original `IMP-001` failure mode is fixed: `_finalize_step_result` now refreshes `ctx.artifacts` after `on_route` before `on_taken` runs, and again before final required-write validation. The added test exercises the exact state-derived artifact-path scenario that previously broke and now passes. The phase notes and decisions are consistent with the implementation and no new regressions were apparent in the changed path.

Key findings / decisions

No remaining blocking or non-blocking findings in this verifier pass. I marked all criteria complete in [criteria.md](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/implement/phases/hook-state-session-and-topology-metadata/criteria.md) and recorded the resolution status in [feedback.md](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/implement/phases/hook-state-session-and-topology-metadata/feedback.md).

Open issues / next step

No open phase-local issues. This phase is verified complete.

I’m reviewing the phase’s current test coverage and the test-phase artifacts first. Then I’ll either add the missing regression coverage or formalize the existing coverage in the phase strategy and feedback so this phase has an explicit behavior-to-test map.

The core behavior already has broad coverage, including the producer’s new LLM-step regression test. I’m looking for the smallest worthwhile refinement that adds phase-relevant signal rather than duplicating that work.

I found one worthwhile refinement: the current regression test proves the final file lands in the refreshed location, but it doesn’t assert what `on_taken` itself observed through `ctx.artifacts`. I’m tightening that test so it directly proves the rebinding contract inside the hook, then I’ll update the test-phase strategy and feedback.

The refined regression test is green. I’m recording the explicit behavior-to-test map now, plus a short feedback note that captures exactly what this test phase added and why it is stable.

Scope considered

Phase-local test work for `hook-state-session-and-topology-metadata`, focused on the route-hook artifact-refresh regression and the phase’s explicit behavior-to-test coverage map.

What I analyzed

I reviewed the current phase artifacts, the shared decisions ledger, and the existing coverage in `tests/contract/test_engine_contracts.py`, `tests/runtime/test_workspace_and_context.py`, `tests/unit/test_simple_surface.py`, and adjacent placeholder/artifact tests to avoid duplicating already-covered behavior.

What I changed

I refined `tests/contract/test_engine_contracts.py::test_route_hooks_re_resolve_artifact_paths_between_on_route_and_on_taken` so it now asserts the path seen inside `on_taken` is already rebound to the post-`on_route` state-derived artifact location, and also checks the persisted state and final filesystem output. That makes the regression test verify the hook context contract directly, not just the eventual write target.

I updated [test_strategy.md](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/test/phases/hook-state-session-and-topology-metadata/test_strategy.md) with an explicit acceptance-criteria-to-test map and appended a concise summary to [feedback.md](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/test/phases/hook-state-session-and-topology-metadata/feedback.md). I also recorded the non-obvious test intent in [decisions.txt](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/decisions.txt).

Key findings / decisions

The useful gap was not final output coverage but hook-context coverage: without asserting what `on_taken` itself observes through `ctx.artifacts`, a stale rebinding bug could be partially masked by later filesystem checks. The refined test closes that gap deterministically.

Validation passed:
`python3 -m py_compile tests/contract/test_engine_contracts.py`
`./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/contract/test_engine_contracts.py -q -k "test_route_hooks_re_resolve_artifact_paths_between_on_route_and_on_taken"`

Open issues / next step

No blocking test gap remains in this targeted area. The test artifacts are ready for auditor review.

Auditing the phase’s test coverage now. I’m checking the refined regression test against the phase acceptance criteria and the test strategy map, then I’ll either clear the phase or record any remaining coverage gap in the audit artifacts.

The added test is pointed at the right failure mode, and the strategy map matches the phase scope. I’m marking the audit criteria complete and appending a short audit outcome so the artifacts reflect that there are no remaining coverage findings.

Scope considered

Phase-local test-audit scope for `hook-state-session-and-topology-metadata`. I reviewed the refined route-hook regression test, the phase test strategy, and the shared decisions that constrain expected behavior.

What I analyzed

I checked the updated [test_strategy.md](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/test/phases/hook-state-session-and-topology-metadata/test_strategy.md), the active [feedback.md](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/test/phases/hook-state-session-and-topology-metadata/feedback.md), the route-hook regression test in [tests/contract/test_engine_contracts.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/tests/contract/test_engine_contracts.py:3990), and the relevant phase decisions in [decisions.txt](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/decisions.txt).

What I reviewed

The refined test now verifies the right failure surface: it asserts the artifact path seen inside `on_taken` already reflects the state mutation from `on_route`, rather than inferring correctness only from final filesystem output. The strategy document also maps the phase acceptance criteria to concrete hook, state/param, session, prompt-namespace, and topology-resume tests, and the listed known gap stays aligned with the phase scope.

Key findings / decisions

No blocking or non-blocking audit findings remain. I marked all audit criteria complete in [criteria.md](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/test/phases/hook-state-session-and-topology-metadata/criteria.md) and appended the audit outcome to [feedback.md](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/test/phases/hook-state-session-and-topology-metadata/feedback.md).

Open issues / next step

No open phase-local test-audit issues. This test phase is complete.

I’m implementing the `feedforward-operations` phase: first I’m reading the phase artifacts and the current code paths for step compilation, providers, replay, and `python_step` so I can fit `llm()` / `classify()` into the existing FSM without widening scope.

The phase notes and prior decisions are loaded. The session file path in the run preamble does not exist on disk, so I’m proceeding from the authoritative request, plan, and prior phase decisions unless I find a relocated session artifact.

I’ve confirmed there isn’t a feedforward phase session artifact yet. Next I’m mapping the existing `llm` step path, provider contracts, and replay/persistence surfaces so the new value operations can reuse those pieces instead of inventing a parallel runtime.

The existing `LLMStep` path is strictly outcome-based. I’m now checking where compiled step kinds, prompt/value references, and runtime context can hold a replayable value node without disturbing route resolution for ordinary LLM steps.

The replay surface doesn’t exist yet; there’s only run metadata and tracing. I’m going to add a narrow operation ledger under the existing runtime context and run folder rather than thread this through unrelated workspace or provider abstractions.

The current runtime doesn’t have a persisted value namespace, so I’m checking checkpoint and context storage now. The cleanest fit looks like a small per-run value store carried alongside step state, then exposed as `ctx.values` for `python_step` and later prompts.

I’ve got the likely shape: a small operation runtime with a persisted run-folder ledger, plus `.step(...)` lowering to deterministic value nodes that behave like `python_step`-style internal handlers. I’m reading the simple-declaration discovery now so I can slot that in without breaking the existing compiler path.

I have enough context to start editing. The change will stay localized to the public surface, provider protocol/rendering, engine/context persistence, and targeted tests; I’m checking the worktree first so I don’t trample unrelated edits.

I’m adding a dedicated operation executor module first so the provider contract, replay ledger, and ambient runtime binding all live in one place. After that I’ll wire the public API and the engine into it.

The executor module is in. I’m wiring the provider boundary next so value operations use a distinct raw-text contract instead of the route/outcome path that powers normal agentic steps.

I’m extending the public surface now. `llm` and `classify` will be first-class callables, and `.step(...)` will lower into an internal deterministic handler instead of pretending to be a route-producing LLM step.

I’ve finished the code path through the engine and public surface. I’m adding focused tests now for explicit standalone calls, compiled value-step nodes, replay hits, mismatch failures, and resume restoring `ctx.values`.

I’ve got the first pass wired through code and tests. I’m running a focused slice first to catch API or replay-contract mistakes before I touch notes or decisions.

`pytest` isn’t on PATH here, so I’m running the same targeted suite through `python -m pytest` instead.

The environment doesn’t have `pytest` installed, so I can’t run the suite directly. I’m switching to syntax checks plus a small inline runtime probe to exercise the new public path and catch integration errors.

The code parses cleanly, but I can’t execute runtime probes here because the environment is missing both `pytest` and `pydantic`. I’m doing a final pass over the touched files now, then I’ll update the phase notes and decision ledger with the non-obvious replay and lowering choices.

The main gaps now are retry coverage for operations and the phase bookkeeping files. I’m adding one focused retry test so the new path isn’t only covered on the happy path.

I’ve updated the ledger and phase notes. I’m doing one last targeted diff review on only the files I touched so the final summary reflects the actual blast radius, not the unrelated dirty worktree around it.

I’ve finished the core feedforward implementation and I’m doing a final regression pass over the touched surfaces before closing the phase. I’m checking the diff shape and the updated phase notes so the handoff stays aligned with the phase contract.

The implementation notes and decision ledger are in the expected shape. I’m checking the working tree one more time because `git diff --stat` only reports tracked edits and I added a new runtime module in this phase.

I’m reading the new operation runtime and the simple-surface lowering now. This is the last pass to catch contract mistakes before I close with the phase summary.

Scope considered

- Active phase `feedforward-operations` only, plus adjacent provider, engine, checkpoint, and simple-surface lowering code needed to satisfy replay/resume behavior.
- Authoritative phase artifacts: `plan.md`, phase `feedback.md`, phase `implementation_notes.md`, and `decisions.txt`.
- I did not pull unrelated dirty files into scope.

What I analyzed

- The simple authoring surface in `autoloop/simple.py`, especially how prior phases lower declarations into the existing compiled FSM.
- Runtime execution and resume/checkpoint flow in `core/engine.py`, `core/context.py`, `core/validation.py`, and checkpoint storage.
- Provider interfaces and rendered/fake providers to add a value-returning operation path without disturbing route-oriented step execution.
- Existing test surfaces for simple authoring, provider boundaries, and engine contracts.

What I changed

- Added feedforward runtime support in `core/operations.py` for standalone `llm()` / `classify()`, retry, deterministic fingerprints, replay, and typed value parsing.
- Exposed public `llm` and `classify` APIs, plus `llm.step(...)` / `classify.step(...)`, in `autoloop/simple.py` and `autoloop/__init__.py`.
- Lowered `.step(...)` feedforward declarations through generated system handlers with `control_routes=False`, so they behave as value nodes and do not create implicit classifier routing.
- Added a provider operation contract with `OperationRequest` / `OperationResponse` and `LLMProvider.run_operation(...)`, then implemented it in rendered and fake providers.
- Persisted replay results in run-local `operation_replay.json` and checkpointed `ctx.values` so completed value nodes survive resume.
- Added targeted tests for standalone calls, retry paths, compiled value nodes, replay across reruns, replay fingerprint mismatch, and resume value restoration.
- Updated the phase implementation notes and appended this turn’s non-obvious decisions under the current `feedforward-operations` block in `decisions.txt`.

Key findings / decisions

- The safest way to add feedforward nodes in this phase was to lower them into the existing FSM as generated system-step handlers rather than add a second execution path.
- Replay drift is treated as a loud failure on an existing replay slot instead of silently recomputing, matching the phase requirement.
- `ctx.values` needed to be persisted through checkpoint/load to make replayed or previously computed operation values available after resume.
- Validation here was limited to `python3 -m py_compile`; this environment does not have `pytest` or `pydantic`, so I could not execute the added tests.

Open issues / next step

- Install the missing test dependencies and run:
  - `python3 -m pytest tests/unit/test_simple_surface.py tests/unit/test_provider_boundary_core.py tests/contract/test_engine_contracts.py`
- After that, run the broader engine/provider regression slice if the repo normally does one.
- The active phase session JSON path from the run preamble was not present in this workspace; it did not block implementation, but it is still absent.

I’m reviewing the feedforward-operations implementation against the phase criteria and the touched runtime/provider surfaces. I’ll inspect the phase artifacts first, then audit the code paths that affect replay, retry, resume, and `.step(...)` lowering.

The tracked diff is empty because most of the core changes are currently untracked in this workspace, so I’m reviewing the file contents directly. I’m checking the new operation runtime first, then the compiler/runtime plumbing around value persistence and prompt references.

I found one suspicious contract edge and I’m tracing it through the provider path before I decide whether it’s blocking. The check is whether direct `llm("...")` and `classify("...")` actually treat plain strings as inline prompts, as the requested API requires.

I’ve confirmed the plain-string prompt path is wrong for direct feedforward calls. I’m checking one more adjacent surface around checkpoint persistence to see whether there’s a second blocking regression or just that single contract miss.

I have one confirmed blocking bug already. I’m checking the runtime prompt interpolation path now, because if recorded `.value` references aren’t resolved at execution time that would be a second blocker for `llm.step(...)`/`classify.step(...)`.

I’ve finished the code audit. There is one blocking contract miss in the direct feedforward API, and it also affects helper usage inside `python_step`. I’m updating the phase review artifacts now.

Scope considered

- Active phase `feedforward-operations` only.
- Request-relevant runtime and regression surfaces: `autoloop/simple.py`, `core/operations.py`, `core/engine.py`, provider models/rendering, checkpoint persistence, and the new tests.
- Phase artifacts: `criteria.md`, `feedback.md`, `implementation_notes.md`, and `decisions.txt`.

What I analyzed

- How standalone `llm()` / `classify()` calls normalize prompts and enter the new value-returning provider path.
- How `.step(...)` declarations lower into the existing compiled FSM and how recorded values are checkpointed and replayed.
- Whether replay and resume logic preserved prior engine invariants without widening the phase scope.
- The added tests to see which runtime paths were actually covered.

What I reviewed

- The new feedforward runtime in `core/operations.py`.
- The direct and step-declared public API surface in `autoloop/simple.py` and `autoloop/__init__.py`.
- Provider boundary changes in `core/providers/{models,protocols,rendered,rendering,fake,turns}.py`.
- Checkpoint persistence changes in `core/stores/protocols.py`, `runtime/stores/filesystem.py`, and engine wiring in `core/engine.py`.
- The phase review artifacts: `feedback.md` updated with one blocking finding; `criteria.md` remains unchecked because the phase is not yet review-complete.

Key findings / decisions

- Blocking: `IMP-001` in [feedback.md](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/implement/phases/feedforward-operations/feedback.md). Direct `llm("...")` / `classify("...")` calls treat bare strings as registry refs instead of inline prompts, so the rendered provider path fails with `prompt ... did not resolve to text`. This breaks the canonical standalone API required by AC-1 and the helper-function path inside `python_step`.
- The minimal fix is to centralize feedforward prompt normalization so bare strings become `Prompt.inline(...)` at the shared operation boundary, then add a rendered-provider regression test for direct/helper string prompts.

Open issues / next step

- Fix `IMP-001` in the implementation and rerun review for this phase.
- After the fix, add or update a regression test that exercises direct `llm("...")` / `classify("...")` through `RenderedLLMProvider`, not only the fake provider path.

I’m fixing the reviewer’s blocking feedforward prompt bug and keeping the blast radius to the shared operation boundary plus targeted tests. First I’m checking the active feedback and the current decisions header, then I’ll patch the operation runtime and notes.

The current decisions file already has a new `feedforward-operations` header for this turn, so I can record this fix there if needed. I’m patching the shared operation prompt resolver and adding a rendered-provider regression test so the reviewer’s scenario is covered directly.

I’m adding one direct rendered-provider regression test and one ambient helper-path regression test, so the fix is covered both outside workflows and inside `python_step`. That keeps the change aligned with the reviewer’s failure scenario instead of only fixing the implementation silently.

I’ve narrowed the implementation to the shared prompt-normalization seam in `core/operations.py`. After that I’m adding the two regression tests and updating the phase notes and decision ledger for this turn.

I’ve applied the code fix and the two regression tests. I’m running a final syntax pass on the touched files, then I’ll update the implementation notes with the reviewer-fix specifics and the limited validation status.

The syntax pass is clean. I’m updating the phase notes now to record the reviewer-driven fix, the additional rendered-provider coverage, and the fact that execution validation is still blocked by missing test dependencies.

Scope considered

- Reviewer finding `IMP-001` only, plus the shared feedforward operation boundary and the minimal regression surfaces needed to prove the fix.
- Touched runtime code: [core/operations.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/core/operations.py), direct public API coverage in [tests/unit/test_simple_surface.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/tests/unit/test_simple_surface.py), and helper-path coverage in [tests/contract/test_engine_contracts.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/tests/contract/test_engine_contracts.py).
- Phase artifacts updated: [implementation_notes.md](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/implement/phases/feedforward-operations/implementation_notes.md) and [decisions.txt](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/full-revised-autoloop-v3-redesign-implementation-16af2351/decisions.txt).

What I analyzed

- The reviewer’s failure path from direct `llm("...")` / `classify("...")` into `_resolve_prompt()` and then `RenderedLLMProvider`.
- The ambient helper path inside `python_step`, which reuses the same operation runtime and therefore had the same prompt-normalization bug.
- Existing rendered-provider test scaffolding so the regression coverage could stay local and phase-scoped.

What I changed

- Fixed the shared operation prompt resolver in [core/operations.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/core/operations.py) by normalizing bare string feedforward prompts to `Prompt.inline(...)` before any registry or file resolution logic runs.
- Added a direct rendered-provider regression test in [tests/unit/test_simple_surface.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/tests/unit/test_simple_surface.py) to verify standalone `llm("...")` and `classify("...")` calls render and execute as inline prompts.
- Added a helper-path regression test in [tests/contract/test_engine_contracts.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/tests/contract/test_engine_contracts.py) to verify `llm("...")` and `classify("...")` inside `python_step` work through `RenderedLLMProvider`.
- Updated the phase notes and appended the non-obvious normalization decision under the current turn’s header in `decisions.txt`.

Key findings / decisions

- The correct fix point was the shared `core.operations` boundary, not the public `autoloop.simple` wrappers, so direct calls and workflow-bound helper calls now share identical prompt semantics.
- I did not broaden the change into unrelated prompt-registry behavior or provider architecture; the bug was isolated to how feedforward operations treated raw strings.

Open issues / next step

- Syntax validation passed with `python3 -m py_compile core/operations.py tests/unit/test_simple_surface.py tests/contract/test_engine_contracts.py`.
- Full test execution is still not possible in this environment because `pytest` and `pydantic` are missing.
- The next step is verifier review of `IMP-001` against the new rendered-provider regression coverage.
