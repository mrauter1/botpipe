I’m mapping the request onto the current codebase and run artifacts first. I’ll read the authoritative plan files, criteria, decisions block, and the runtime areas that own hooks, route finalization, worklists, and failures so the plan stays implementation-ready and scoped.

The run artifacts are mostly blank, so the main work is deriving a concrete sequence from the existing runtime. I’m locating the engine, hook normalization, route effects, worklist handling, and failure/checkpoint paths now to anchor the plan in actual modules instead of spec-only decomposition.

I’ve confirmed the runtime already has partial support for some requested pieces, especially worklist helpers and typed `FailureContext`. The remaining plan needs to target inconsistent edges: legacy hook/result forms, route effects, tuple-heavy execution returns, and resume/compiler/cache boundaries.

The codebase is further along than the spec implies in some areas: `ctx.worklists`, `current_worklist`, runtime trace schema IDs, and typed execution errors already exist. The plan now needs to distinguish completion work from cleanup and line up the risky refactors around discovery/compiler/engine without inventing unnecessary architecture.

Plan shape is clear now. I’m drafting a phased implementation that starts with public-surface and normalization removals, then consolidates engine/failure/result semantics, and ends with compiler/resume/history/docs tightening so the high-risk refactors land before lower-risk cleanup.

I’ve got enough coverage to write the plan artifacts now. The plan will explicitly treat existing collaborator splits and worklist helpers as the baseline, so later implementers finish the delta instead of rebuilding parallel infrastructure.

The plan artifacts are written. I’m doing one pass to verify the phase ordering, dependency coherence, and that the plan doesn’t promise architecture work the repo already partially has.

Updated the run-local planning artifacts:

- [plan.md](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/standalone-remaining-delta-implementation-spec-g-e919a184/runs/run-20260503T001920Z-8f0e7926/artifacts/plan/plan.md) now contains a four-phase implementation plan with milestones, interface targets, intentional breaks, regression controls, risks, and rollback boundaries.
- [phase_plan.yaml](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/standalone-remaining-delta-implementation-spec-g-e919a184/runs/run-20260503T001920Z-8f0e7926/artifacts/plan/phase_plan.yaml) now defines the ordered machine-readable phases and dependencies.
- [feedback.md](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/standalone-remaining-delta-implementation-spec-g-e919a184/runs/run-20260503T001920Z-8f0e7926/artifacts/plan/feedback.md) and [decisions.txt](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/standalone-remaining-delta-implementation-spec-g-e919a184/runs/run-20260503T001920Z-8f0e7926/decisions.txt) were appended with the planning rationale that should survive later turns.

Key direction: finish the existing collaborator/worklist/failure foundations instead of rebuilding them, front-load public contract cleanup and execution normalization, then land runtime correctness and resume/cache/schema/doc work as separate later slices. No tests were run because this turn only authored planning artifacts.
