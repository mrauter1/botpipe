I’m treating this as a planning pass for the full-suite compatibility recovery after repo-local `workflows/` support landed. I’ll inspect the authoritative run artifacts and the workflow-resolution/optimization/runtime areas that the failing suites point at, then I’ll write an implementation-ready plan into the run-local planning files.

I’ve confirmed there are no later clarifications in the raw log and the run-local planning artifacts are mostly empty. Next I’m mapping the failure clusters to the concrete runtime and helper modules so the plan stays centered on shared contracts rather than scattered test-specific patches.

The search results are already showing the contract split: discovery/resolution semantics now straddle `workflows/`, `.autoloop/workflows/`, and installed `autoloop/workflows/`, while optimization helpers and packaged workflow tests still assert canonical stored paths. I’m drilling into the actual resolver/catalog/manifest code now so the plan can isolate the shared fixes and the regression surfaces they touch.

I’ve got the main shared modules. The likely repair points are concentrated rather than broad: catalog root precedence and metadata normalization in `autoloop/core/workflow_catalog.py`, workspace/reference persistence in runtime inspection paths, and optimizer artifact normalization in `autoloop_optimizer/optimization.py`. I’m pulling the exact functions and failing test cases that define those contracts so the plan can specify milestones and rollback points precisely.

I’ve confirmed the resolver has two distinct loading paths: catalog entries with importable package modules versus isolated path loads. The risky seam is where repo-local `workflows/` entries are now treated as importable `workflows.*` packages for named/path resolution, while explicit class references and optimizer manifests still depend on older isolated or package-path behavior. I’m running the targeted suites with the project venv next so the plan reflects the actual current breakpoints, not just inferred ones.

The targeted failures line up cleanly with the request. Resolver regressions are all from the same structural shift: repo-local `workflows/` is winning discovery and import-based loading in places where the older contract still expects `.autoloop/workflows/` precedence or isolated module loading. Optimizer failures are downstream: observability validation is rejecting test bundles early, which then zeroes eligible runs and hides later route-tag behavior, and the selected-workflow manifest now records repo-local roots where older publication contracts still expect package-style `autoloop/workflows/...` paths.

The representative packaged-workflow failures aren’t random. They split into two central contracts: compile-time control-route declarations in the packaged workflows themselves, and runtime/packaging helpers that still assume installed-package surfaces under `autoloop/workflows/...` when seeding temp repos, evidence paths, and selected-workflow source manifests. I’m checking those shared interfaces now so the plan can sequence them in a way that avoids chasing suite-by-suite fallout.

I have enough to pin the work into concrete buckets now. The remaining details I’m checking are the route-contract constants and the helper installers that seed temp repos for packaged-workflow tests, because those decide whether this should be a two-phase or three-phase implementation plan.

I’ve finished the analysis pass and I’m writing the run-local plan artifacts now. The plan will break the work into shared-contract slices: first catalog/loader resolution semantics, then optimizer and selected-workflow manifest normalization, then packaged-workflow route/artifact contract repair plus full-suite proof so the implementation phase can work in dependency order instead of patching suites one by one.

I’m applying the artifact edits now: `plan.md` will become the single human-readable source of truth, `phase_plan.yaml` will get the ordered phase payload, and I’ll append only the non-obvious compatibility decisions needed to keep later turns from drifting back into suite-by-suite patching.

The artifacts are written. I’m doing a quick integrity pass now to catch any YAML/format drift before I close: the main things to verify are the `phases:` block shape and that the decisions stayed under the current runtime-created header only.

The integrity check found one issue: `phase_plan.yaml` still has the runtime seed `phases: []` line above the authored phase block, which would make the YAML invalid. I’m removing only that stale empty list so the runtime-owned metadata stays intact and the authored payload is valid.

Updated the run-local planning artifacts:

- [plan.md](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/goal-implement-a-greenfield-autoloop-v3-worklist-3cb1f2e6/runs/run-20260505T133333Z-ef073886/artifacts/plan/plan.md)
- [phase_plan.yaml](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/goal-implement-a-greenfield-autoloop-v3-worklist-3cb1f2e6/runs/run-20260505T133333Z-ef073886/artifacts/plan/phase_plan.yaml)
- [feedback.md](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/goal-implement-a-greenfield-autoloop-v3-worklist-3cb1f2e6/runs/run-20260505T133333Z-ef073886/artifacts/plan/feedback.md)
- [decisions.txt](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/goal-implement-a-greenfield-autoloop-v3-worklist-3cb1f2e6/runs/run-20260505T133333Z-ef073886/decisions.txt)

The plan is a 3-phase recovery sequence: first restore workflow resolution semantics, then fix optimizer observability/source-manifest contracts, then repair the remaining packaged-workflow route/artifact regressions and prove the full suite. I also validated the targeted failure clusters with the project venv and used those concrete breakpoints to drive the phase boundaries rather than broad speculative cleanup.

I’m verifying the run-local plan artifacts against the request, the decisions ledger, and the concrete failure evidence from the targeted suites. I’ll update the criteria checkboxes to match the actual audit result, append any findings with stable IDs to `feedback.md`, and then return the loop-control status.

I found one blocking issue and it is central, not cosmetic: the plan locks in repo-local canonical-name precedence for named workflow resolution, but the request and the failing reference-resolution tests explicitly show mixed-root cases where the older contract still expects `.autoloop/workflows/` to win. I’m recording that as a blocking finding and marking the criteria accordingly.

Scope considered
- The run-local planning artifacts in `artifacts/plan/`
- The immutable request snapshot and current turn `decisions.txt`
- The concrete workflow-resolution tests directly cited by the request and implicated by the plan’s Phase 1 direction

What I analyzed
- The Phase 1 resolution strategy in `plan.md`
- The ordered phase contract in `phase_plan.yaml`
- The planner-authored non-obvious direction recorded in `decisions.txt`
- The mixed-root reference expectations in `tests/runtime/test_workflow_reference_resolution.py`

What I reviewed
- `plan.md`
- `phase_plan.yaml`
- `criteria.md`
- `feedback.md`
- `decisions.txt`
- Request coverage for workflow-resolution, optimizer, packaged-workflow, and full-suite acceptance criteria

Key findings / decisions
- Recorded `PLAN-001` as `blocking` in `feedback.md`.
- The plan currently hard-codes repo-local `workflows/` named-resolution precedence, but the request and failing reference-resolution tests explicitly require restoring mixed-root cases where `.autoloop/workflows/` remains authoritative.
- Updated `criteria.md` to leave `Intent Fidelity`, `Behavioral Safety`, `Completeness`, and `Feasibility / Compatibility` unchecked; `Technical Debt` remains checked.

Open issues / next step
- Planner needs to revise Phase 1 so named/workspace resolution restores the observed `.autoloop/workflows/` contract in mixed-root cases, then add a superseding direction for the conflicting decision entry before this plan can be marked complete.
