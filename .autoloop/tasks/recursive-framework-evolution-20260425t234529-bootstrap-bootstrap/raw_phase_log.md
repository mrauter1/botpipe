I’m treating the supplied implementation spec as the default contract and first checking the current repository surfaces it touches: provider core/runtime boundaries, engine retry/handoff flow, and the existing plan artifacts I need to update.

I’ve confirmed the existing plan artifacts are effectively empty, so I’m now reading the current provider/engine surfaces and the authoritative run log to anchor the plan to the actual code and any later clarifications.

The current runtime providers still own verifier prompt rendering and outcome parsing, exactly the boundary the request wants removed. I’m now mapping where retries, routes, checkpoints, and event data live so the plan can sequence changes without breaking existing semantics.

I’ve got enough code context to draft the plan structure. I’m doing one more focused pass on route-effect validation and checkpoint cloning so the plan calls out the exact regression points for `Handoff`, `Event.handoff`, and persisted pending handoffs.

I’ve finished the codebase pass. The remaining work is writing the actual plan artifacts so the implementation phases line up with the real regression surfaces: runtime `_common` extraction, engine request/control-contract rebuilding, additive checkpoint schema, and docs/tests that currently freeze the old narrow prompt contract.

I’m writing the plan artifacts now. The plan will stay close to the request snapshot, but I’m encoding the codebase-specific constraints that matter for safe implementation: runtime `_common` split, additive checkpoint schema, retry classification boundaries, and the wider doc/test sweep needed to remove stale prompt-contract wording.

The phase file needed a quick correction because the initial patch duplicated the `phases` key. I’m fixing that before validation so the runtime-owned metadata stays intact and the YAML parses cleanly.

The content edits are in place. I’m validating the machine-readable phase file with the repo’s virtualenv Python and doing a quick artifact readback to make sure the written plan is internally consistent before I close the turn.

PyYAML is missing from the repo virtualenv, so I’m checking for a system Python with `yaml` available before I close. I want the required `yaml.safe_load` validation done without mutating the workspace environment if there’s already a usable interpreter.

Updated the planner artifacts for this run:

- [plan.md](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/recursive-framework-evolution-20260425t234529-bootstrap-bootstrap/plan/plan.md) now contains an implementation-ready plan covering the core/runtime provider split, retry policy semantics, handoff persistence/delivery, compatibility constraints, regression controls, validation steps, and risk register.
- [phase_plan.yaml](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/recursive-framework-evolution-20260425t234529-bootstrap-bootstrap/plan/phase_plan.yaml) now defines 5 ordered phases with dependencies, scope boundaries, acceptance criteria, deliverables, risks, and rollback notes.
- [feedback.md](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/recursive-framework-evolution-20260425t234529-bootstrap-bootstrap/plan/feedback.md) has a concise change summary.
- [decisions.txt](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/recursive-framework-evolution-20260425t234529-bootstrap-bootstrap/decisions.txt) has the non-obvious decisions that should survive later turns.

Key planning decisions:
- Keep the semantic `LLMProvider` surface intact and introduce the new boundary underneath it via `RenderedLLMProvider` plus `ProviderTransport`.
- Treat retries as provider-only failures, with `PairStep` retries restarting from producer and default `max_attempts=3`.
- Make handoff persistence additive and scoped, and reject handoff-to-`SystemStep` in this pass.
- Preserve raw output as telemetry only, never as rendered prompt input.

Validation:
- Parsed [phase_plan.yaml](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/recursive-framework-evolution-20260425t234529-bootstrap-bootstrap/plan/phase_plan.yaml) successfully with `python3` + `yaml.safe_load` (`yaml-ok 5`).

I’ve isolated two material plan gaps: the handoff authoring/export surface is not explicitly covered, and retry-exhaustion checkpoint semantics are not explicitly planned even though the request requires them. I’m recording those in the verifier artifacts and setting the checklist accordingly.

Scope considered
Planning artifacts for the provider-boundary refactor plus retry/handoff feature: `plan.md`, `phase_plan.yaml`, `feedback.md`, `criteria.md`, and shared decisions/request context for intent alignment.

What I analyzed
The immutable request snapshot, the current plan artifacts, the shared decisions block, and the repo surfaces the plan must cover for compatibility and regression safety: provider shims, engine retry/checkpoint behavior, and workflow authoring exports.

What I reviewed
`plan.md` for intent coverage and compatibility notes, `phase_plan.yaml` for phase quality and YAML validity, `feedback.md` for continuity plus new findings, and `criteria.md` for accurate gating status. I also re-validated `phase_plan.yaml` with `python3` + `yaml.safe_load`.

Key findings / decisions
Two blocking plan gaps remain.
`PLAN-001`: the plan does not explicitly include the required public handoff export/shim updates in `core/__init__.py`, `workflow/__init__.py`, and `workflow/primitives.py`.
`PLAN-002`: the plan does not explicitly require retry-exhaustion checkpoints to persist retry count plus useful failure context, even though the request and acceptance criteria require that behavior.
I updated `criteria.md` to leave the plan incomplete and appended both findings to `feedback.md`.

Open issues / next step
The planner needs to revise the artifacts to explicitly cover the handoff public surface and retry-exhaustion checkpoint semantics, then rerun verification.

I’m revising the plan against the verifier’s two blocking findings: the missing public handoff export surface and the missing retry-exhaustion checkpoint semantics. First I’m checking the current artifacts and the latest decisions header so I only append within this turn’s block.

I’ve got the exact corrections. I’m updating the narrative plan and machine-readable phases so they explicitly cover the workflow-facing handoff exports and retry-exhaustion checkpoint data, then I’ll re-validate the YAML.

The corrections are in. I’m re-reading the updated sections and re-validating `phase_plan.yaml` with `yaml.safe_load` so the machine-readable plan stays clean after the additions.

Updated the plan artifacts to close both verifier findings.

`plan.md` now explicitly covers:
- public handoff authoring/export work in `core/__init__.py`, `workflow/__init__.py`, and `workflow/primitives.py`
- retry-exhaustion checkpoint semantics, including persisted attempt-consumption data alongside useful failure context

`phase_plan.yaml` now includes those requirements in the relevant phases’ `in_scope`, `acceptance_criteria`, and `deliverables`.

I also appended a concise resolution note to [feedback.md](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/recursive-framework-evolution-20260425t234529-bootstrap-bootstrap/plan/feedback.md) and recorded the non-obvious compatibility/checkpoint constraints under the latest header in [decisions.txt](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/recursive-framework-evolution-20260425t234529-bootstrap-bootstrap/decisions.txt).

Validation:
- Parsed [phase_plan.yaml](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/.autoloop/tasks/recursive-framework-evolution-20260425t234529-bootstrap-bootstrap/plan/phase_plan.yaml) successfully with `python3` + `yaml.safe_load` (`yaml-ok 5`).

I’m re-running a focused verification pass on the revised plan artifacts, especially the two previously blocking areas and the public compatibility surfaces they touch, before I mark the checklist final.

The revised plan now covers the two previously missing intent points, and I’m not seeing a remaining correctness or compatibility gap. I’m updating the checklist to final and recording that there are no remaining blocking findings.

Scope considered
The active plan artifacts for the provider-boundary refactor, retry policy, handoff support, checkpoint persistence, public workflow authoring surface, and doc/test rollout.

What I analyzed
The revised `plan.md`, `phase_plan.yaml`, prior verifier findings in `feedback.md`, the checked criteria state, the shared decisions ledger, and the immutable request requirements those artifacts must still satisfy.

What I reviewed
I re-validated `phase_plan.yaml` with `python3` + `yaml.safe_load`, checked metadata/dependency ordering/non-empty required lists, and re-audited the previously blocking areas: workflow-facing handoff exports and retry-exhaustion checkpoint semantics.

Key findings / decisions
No remaining blocking findings.
The revised plan now explicitly covers `core/__init__.py`, `workflow/__init__.py`, and `workflow/primitives.py` for the public handoff surface.
The retry phase now explicitly includes additive checkpoint/failure-context persistence for consumed retry attempts.
I updated `criteria.md` so all verification boxes are checked and appended a verifier closure note to `feedback.md`.

Open issues / next step
No open verifier issues in the planning artifacts. The plan is ready for downstream implementation work.

I’m treating this as a phase-scoped core refactor: add the rendered turn boundary, shared renderer/parser, and the semantic wrapper without pulling runtime transport refactors into scope. I’m starting by reading the active phase artifacts and the current provider model/layout so I can fit the changes to existing contracts before editing.

I’ve confirmed the active phase is narrower than the full plan: core provider boundary only. Next I’m reading the existing provider models, runtime helper split, and the current tests so the new abstractions land without drifting the semantic interface.

The existing split is clear now: `runtime/providers/_common.py` currently holds both transport-safe helpers and workflow-aware helpers, and the runtime providers are still semantic. I’m checking the exact `Outcome`, prompt, and session models next so the new core modules can preserve types and metadata shape instead of inventing new ones.

I have enough context to start the core edit slice. I’m going to add the new provider-boundary modules first, then make the smallest runtime import/test updates needed to point outcome parsing at core without pulling the transport refactor into this phase.

The core boundary modules are in place. I’m doing the compatibility pass now: runtime providers will keep their current transport behavior for this phase, but outcome parsing will point at the new core module so the workflow-aware parser stops living under `runtime/providers`.

I’ve kept the runtime side intentionally narrow: only the parser import boundary changed there. I’m adding focused tests around the new core renderer and wrapper now, and I’ll retarget the existing parser tests to the core module instead of duplicating them under runtime helpers.

I’ve hit one environment quirk: plain `python` isn’t on PATH here, so I’m using the repo’s `.venv` for validation. I’m running the focused provider tests first to catch import/contract issues before touching notes or broader checks.

The core tests passed, and the existing runtime provider tests still pass with the parser moved to core. I’m doing one more regression pass on backend resolution and engine contracts because the request models changed shape, even though engine behavior shouldn’t change in this phase.

The code path changes are stable. One cleanup remains: `compileall` refreshed checked-in `__pycache__` artifacts in this repo, and I’m removing only those generated binary diffs so the change set stays source-only.

The code is done; I’m writing the phase artifact notes now. I’m recording one non-obvious boundary decision in the shared ledger as required, then I’ll do a last source-only diff review before closing.

**Scope considered**

Phase-scoped core provider boundary only: new rendered turn abstractions, shared core renderer/parser, semantic wrapper, and the smallest runtime/test updates needed to consume the core parser without doing the transport refactor. Main files: [models.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/core/providers/models.py), [turns.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/core/providers/turns.py), [rendering.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/core/providers/rendering.py), [parsing.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/core/providers/parsing.py), [rendered.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/core/providers/rendered.py).

**What I analyzed**

I reviewed the existing semantic provider surface, the workflow-aware helpers in `runtime/providers/_common.py`, the current Codex/Claude runtime providers, backend resolution, and the provider/engine tests to keep this phase additive and default-compatible.

**What I changed**

I added `RenderedProviderTurn`, `ProviderTurnResult`, `ProviderTransport`, `ProviderArtifactRef`, and `ProviderTurnContext`, and extended the semantic request models with defaulted artifact/retry/handoff metadata. I added a shared markdown renderer and a shared `parse_outcome_json(...)` in core, then added `RenderedLLMProvider` to translate semantic requests into rendered turns while keeping `VerifierRequest.raw_output` as deprecated telemetry only.

I also moved runtime outcome parsing usage onto the new core parser with minimal runtime edits in [codex.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/runtime/providers/codex.py) and [claude.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/runtime/providers/claude.py), and added focused tests in [test_provider_boundary_core.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/tests/unit/test_provider_boundary_core.py) plus updated parser imports in [test_runtime_providers.py](/home/rauter/autoloop_v3_bkp/autoloop_v3/tests/runtime/test_runtime_providers.py).

**Key findings / decisions**

The runtime transport refactor is still intentionally deferred: Codex/Claude remain semantic providers in this phase. The shared renderer excludes raw provider output and related telemetry, and it keeps the runtime contract sections deterministic by always rendering the tables, including placeholder rows when a section is empty. `VerifierRequest.raw_output` remains on the request model for compatibility, but `RenderedLLMProvider` ignores it when building the shared prompt.

Validation passed with:
`.venv/bin/python -m compileall core/providers runtime/providers tests/unit/test_provider_boundary_core.py tests/runtime/test_runtime_providers.py`
`.venv/bin/pytest -q tests/unit/test_provider_boundary_core.py`
`.venv/bin/pytest -q tests/runtime/test_runtime_providers.py`
`.venv/bin/pytest -q tests/runtime/test_provider_backends.py`
`.venv/bin/pytest -q tests/contract/test_engine_contracts.py`

**Open issues / next step**

The next phase should replace the semantic Codex/Claude runtime providers with pure `ProviderTransport` implementations and update backend resolution to return `RenderedLLMProvider(transport)`. Engine-side artifact contract injection, retry behavior, handoff delivery, and docs/baseline updates are still pending by design for later phases.

I’m reviewing the phase-scoped provider-boundary changes against the active criteria and the shared decisions ledger. I’ll inspect the changed core provider files, confirm the runtime parser boundary move, then update the phase criteria and feedback with any findings.

I’ve got the phase artifacts and ledger. Now I’m reading the new core provider modules and the small runtime parser rewiring in detail to check for intent gaps, hidden regressions, and whether AC-1 through AC-3 are actually met.

I found one material acceptance gap and one smaller design issue. I’m recording both now and leaving the phase incomplete because AC-3 is not actually met by the current runtime behavior.

Scope considered

Phase-local review of the `provider-boundary-core` implementation only: the new `core/providers/*` boundary modules, the minimal runtime parser rewiring in `runtime/providers/*`, the related tests, and the phase artifacts under `.autoloop/tasks/recursive-framework-evolution-20260425t234529-bootstrap-bootstrap/implement/phases/provider-boundary-core/`.

What I analyzed

I compared the active phase contract and shared decisions ledger against the changed provider models, parser, renderer, semantic wrapper, runtime helper/runtime provider usage, and the new focused tests. I also checked whether the implementation actually satisfies AC-1 through AC-3 rather than only adding the requested files.

What I reviewed

I updated `criteria.md` to reflect that compatibility/validation are acceptable but correctness, behavioral safety, and simplicity are not yet fully satisfied. I appended two findings to `feedback.md`: one blocking acceptance gap around runtime-side outcome parsing still living in the runtime provider layer, and one non-blocking issue about the inert render-policy surface.

Key findings / decisions

The blocking issue is that `CodexProvider` and `ClaudeProvider` still call `parse_outcome_json(...)` in `run_verifier`/`run_llm`, so AC-3 is not met even though the parser function was moved into `core/providers/parsing.py`. The non-blocking issue is that `ProviderPromptRenderPolicy` exists but cannot be supplied to `render_provider_turn(...)`, so the requested render-policy hook is present only as dead surface.

Open issues / next step

This phase should not be marked complete until verifier/LLM parsing is owned by the new core rendered-provider boundary rather than by the runtime providers. After that, the renderer API should expose the new prompt policy object so later engine integration does not require another interface change.
